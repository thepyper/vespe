Agent my_agent: [RESPONSE]: [
  {"type": "tool_call", "name": "read_file", "args": {"path": "test.txt"}},
  {"type": "text_response", "content": "File content: \n (will be displayed here)"},
  {"type": "thought", "content": "Now, I need to summarize the file content."},
  {"type": "tool_call", "name": "echo", "args": {"text": "(summary of test.txt)" }},

Note: Since the actual output of the "read_file" and "echo" tools will be used as inputs for other actions, I'll display placeholder responses.
