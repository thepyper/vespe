  "reply": "Here are some suggestions to improve your `README.md` file:\n\n1.  **Add a \"Why Vespe?\" or \"Motivation\" Section:** Explain the unique benefits of `vespe` compared to other tools, highlighting its collaborative mind-mapping and dynamic canvas approach with LLMs.\n2.  **Include Visuals (Screenshots/GIFs):** Visual demonstrations of `vespe` in action (e.g., `watch` mode, `@answer` tag transformation, `@task` usage) would significantly enhance engagement and understanding.\n3.  **Add a Table of Contents:** For a comprehensive README like this, a Table of Contents at the beginning would greatly improve navigation.\n4.  **Create a Quick Reference/Cheatsheet for Tags:** A concise table summarizing each tag's purpose and a minimal example would be useful for quick lookups.\n5.  **Introduce an \"Advanced Usage\" or \"Best Practices\" Section:** Cover topics like error handling, debugging prompts, performance considerations, and potential integrations with editors/IDEs.\n6.  **Add a Community/Support Section:** If available, include links to community forums, Discord channels, or other support resources.\n7.  **Consider a Future Plans/Roadmap Section (Optional):** Briefly outlining future developments can generate interest.\n8.  **Refine \"NO-WARRANTY\" Placement:** Consider moving this section closer to the \"License\" or into a dedicated \"Disclaimer\" section at the end to improve flow.\n9.  **Ensure Consistent Code Block Highlighting:** Verify that all code blocks use appropriate language highlighting (e.g., `shell`, `markdown`).\n10. **Clarify \"Context\" vs. \"Document\" Usage:** While \"context\" is a core concept, consistent terminology or a clear distinction between \"context\" and \"document\" could improve clarity.\n11. **Provide a Slightly More Complex \"Getting Started\" Example:** An example that incorporates `@include` or `@set` could better showcase `vespe`'s power early on.\n",
