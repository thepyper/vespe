  "reply": "Okay, I will write the \"Installation\" section.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the project's nature to provide accurate installation instructions. Based on the file structure, it appears to be a Rust project (`Cargo.toml`, `src/`) and potentially a VS Code extension (`extensions/vscode/package.json`).\n\nI will start by examining `Cargo.toml` to determine how the Rust part of the project is built and installed.Okay, `Cargo.toml` confirms this is a Rust project, \"vespe,\" with a CLI binary \"ctx\" at `src/bin/ctx/main.rs`. Now, I'll examine `extensions/vscode/package.json` for the VS Code extension details.I'll create an \"Installation\" section for Vespe, covering both the Rust CLI and VS Code extension. It will include prerequisites (Rust, Node.js/npm), instructions for installing the `ctx` binary via `cargo`, and steps for building and installing the VS Code extension from source. This will be documented in a new file: `docs/installation.md`.`docs/installation.md` is created. Committing it now.Staged `docs/installation.md`. Committing now.Installation docs created and committed. Request fulfilled.`docs/installation.md` is committed. Other changes are irrelevant. Request complete.\n",
