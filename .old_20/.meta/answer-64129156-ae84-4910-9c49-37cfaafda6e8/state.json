I understand that my previous response was not helpful.\n\nI will now resume my previous task, which was to assist you with software engineering tasks. I will wait for your next command.\n\nIf you were expecting me to continue with a previous task, please remind me of what we were doing. I do not have a memory of past conversations beyond the current turn unless explicitly saved using the `save_memory` tool.\n\nGiven the directory structure, it appears to be a Rust project. If you have a specific task in mind, please let me know. For example, you could ask me to:\n\n*   Read a specific file.\n*   Search for a pattern in the codebase.\n*   Run a shell command.\n*   Help with a coding task (bug fix, feature, refactoring).\n*   Explain some code.\n\nPlease provide your next command or clarify what you would like to do.\n"
