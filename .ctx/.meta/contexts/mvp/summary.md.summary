  "summary_content": "The user and I collaborated to implement an iterative context execution feature for the `ctx` tool. The goal was to internalize LLM calls, allowing `ctx execute <context_name>` to process contexts containing executable tags like `@answer`. The solution involved refining data structures (`LineData` enum for content, `Line` struct for metadata including `source_file` and `source_line_number`), ensuring files are always re-read for up-to-date content, and implementing a loop that composes the context, identifies the first `@answer` tag, sends the preceding content to an LLM, and replaces the tag with the LLM's response in the original file. The feature was successfully implemented and verified with a test case where an `@answer` tag in `test_answer.md` was replaced by \"Hello from Gemini!\".\n"
