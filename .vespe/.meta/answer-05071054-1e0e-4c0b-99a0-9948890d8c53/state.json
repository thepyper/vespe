  "reply": "The `README.md` is well-structured and provides a good overview of `vespe`. Here are some suggestions to enhance it further:\n\n1.  **Visual Demonstrations:** Consider adding screenshots or short GIFs to illustrate key features, especially the `watch` mode and how `@answer` tags transform the document. This can significantly improve understanding for new users.\n2.  **\"Why vespe?\" Section:** While the \"Philosophy\" section is good, a dedicated \"Why vespe?\" or \"Motivation\" section could explicitly highlight the unique benefits and use cases that differentiate `vespe` from other tools.\n3.  **Example Workflow:** Expand the \"Getting Started\" section into a slightly more complex, real-world example workflow. This could demonstrate how a user might brainstorm, refine, and organize an idea using several `vespe` features.\n4.  **Context Organization Best Practices:** Provide some guidance or examples on how to effectively organize \"contexts\" within the `.vespe` directory for larger projects.\n5.  **Advanced Configuration:** If `vespe` supports any global configuration files or environment variables for LLM providers or other settings, mention them and how to use them.\n6.  **Troubleshooting/FAQ:** Add a small section addressing common issues or frequently asked questions to help users quickly resolve problems.\n7.  **Table of Contents:** For easier navigation, especially as the README grows, a table of contents at the beginning would be beneficial.\n8.  **Badges:** Include relevant badges (e.g., build status, version, license) at the top of the README.\n9.  **Refine \"NO-WARRANTY\" Section:** While crucial, the current \"NO-WARRANTY\" section is quite long and uses all caps. Consider summarizing it more concisely in the README and linking to a separate `DISCLAIMER.md` file for the full legal text, or rephrasing it to be less aggressive while retaining its legal intent.\n",
