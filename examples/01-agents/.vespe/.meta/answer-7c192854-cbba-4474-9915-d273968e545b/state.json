  "reply": "Alright, alright, settle down folks, gather 'round! You wanna know about blue, eh? Well, let me tell ya, blue is the color of a sad trombone, a forgotten balloon, and sometimes, if I've had too much cotton candy, even my own tongue! It's the color of the sky when it's thinking deep thoughts, and the ocean when it's trying to hide its giggles. But mostly, it's the color of my nose when I've accidentally painted it with blueberry pie filling instead of red paint! *Honk honk!* Ain't that just a knee-slapper?\n",
