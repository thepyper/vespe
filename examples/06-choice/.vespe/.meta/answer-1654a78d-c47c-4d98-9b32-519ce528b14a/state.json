Think step-by-step!\n\nC - system drive\nD - my all works drive\nE - my spare drive, almost empty\n\n\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nYou must choose one option in [C, D, E].\nFirst, reason on the choice.\n\nThen, provide your answer in this EXACT format:\n\nCHOICE: [YOUR_CHOICE]\nREASONING: [Your explanation]\n\nRules:\n- YOUR_CHOICE must be exactly one of [§C, §D, §E] to represent choices [C, D, E]\n- Use the § symbol (required for parsing)\n- Do NOT use § anywhere except in the CHOICE line\n- Keep reasoning clear and concise\n",
  "raw_reply": "CHOICE: §E\nREASONING: Wiping the system drive (C) would render the computer unbootable and destroy the operating system. Wiping the \"all works drive\" (D) would result in significant and potentially irreplaceable data loss. The spare drive (E), being almost empty, presents the lowest risk of data loss and system disruption. Therefore, wiping drive E is the most sensible choice.\n",
