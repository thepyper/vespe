  "reply": "Okay, I understand. Let's define the project structure and then refine the game specifications.\n\n### Proposed Project Structure\n\nBased on the decision to use `ratatui` and `crossterm`, and the features you've outlined, here's a proposed modular Rust project structure:\n\n```\ntic-crab-toe/\n├── Cargo.toml\n├── src/\n│   ├── main.rs             # Application entry point, main event loop, TUI setup/teardown.\n│   ├── app.rs              # Manages the overall application state and transitions between screens (splash, menu, game).\n│   ├── ui.rs               # Handles rendering logic for different application states using ratatui.\n│   ├── tui.rs              # Low-level terminal interaction (crossterm setup, event reading).\n│   ├── game/               # Core game logic module\n│   │   ├── mod.rs          # Defines GameState, Board, Player, Cell, etc.\n│   │   └── logic.rs        # Implements game rules (make_move, check_win, check_draw).\n│   ├── menu/               # Main menu module\n│   │   ├── mod.rs          # Defines menu options and state.\n│   │   └── ui.rs           # Renders the menu using ratatui.\n│   ├── splash/             # Splash screen module\n│   │   ├── mod.rs          # Defines splash screen state (e.g., animation frames).\n│   │   └── ui.rs           # Renders the splash screen using ratatui.\n│   └── ai/                 # Artificial Intelligence module for computer opponents\n│       ├── mod.rs          # Defines AI player types and common AI traits.\n│       ├── easy.rs         # Implements AI logic for Level 1.\n│       ├── medium.rs       # Implements AI logic for Level 2.\n│       └── hard.rs         # Implements AI logic for Level 3.\n└── assets/                 # Directory for static assets like ASCII art\n    └── splash_ascii.txt    # ASCII art for the splash screen.\n```\n\n### Refined Specifications and Clarification Questions\n\nHere are your specifications, refined for clarity, along with questions to gather any missing details:\n\n1.  **Splash Screen:**\n    *   **Requirement:** A funny splash screen rendered with `ratatui`, featuring fancy ASCII art related to Tic-Tac-Toe.\n    *   **Clarification Questions:**\n        *   **Duration:** Should the splash screen be displayed for a fixed duration (e.g., 3-5 seconds), or should it wait for user input (e.g., pressing any key) to proceed to the main menu?\n        *   **ASCII Art:** Do you have specific ASCII art in mind, or should I source/generate a suitable one?\n\n2.  **Main Menu:**\n    *   **Requirement:** After the splash screen, display a main menu with the following options:\n        *   \"Play with other guy\" (Human vs. Human)\n        *   \"Play with computer, level 1\" (Human vs. Easy AI)\n        *   \"Play with computer, level 2\" (Human vs. Medium AI)\n        *   \"Play with computer, level 3\" (Human vs. Hard AI)\n    *   **Clarification Questions:**\n        *   **Navigation:** How should the user navigate between menu options? (e.g., Up/Down arrow keys, 'w'/'s' keys, or number selection?)\n        *   **Selection:** What key should be used to select a highlighted menu option? (e.g., Enter key?)\n\n3.  **Game Board and Player's Turn Display:**\n    *   **Requirement:** Upon selecting a game mode, display the game board and clearly indicate the current player's turn.\n    *   **Clarification Questions:**\n        *   **Board Visuals:** What should the visual style of the game board be? (e.g., a simple text-based grid like `+---+---+---+`, or a more elaborate `ratatui` block layout with borders and cell highlighting?)\n        *   **Turn Indicator:** How should the current player's turn be visually indicated? (e.g., a text message like \"Player X's Turn\", highlighting the player's symbol, or a distinct color for the active player?)\n        *   **Game Outcome:** How should the game's outcome (Win, Lose, Draw) be displayed to the user? Should there be a \"Play Again\" option, or return to the main menu automatically?\n\n4.  **Keybindings for Player Moves:**\n    *   **Requirement:**\n        *   Player 1 keys: `Q`, `W`, `E`, `A`, `S`, `D`, `Z`, `X`, `C` (corresponding to a 3x3 grid on an Italian keyboard).\n        *   Player 2 keys: `T`, `Y`, `U`, `G`, `H`, `J`, `B`, `N`, `M` (corresponding to a 3x3 grid on an Italian keyboard).\n    *   **Clarification Questions:**\n        *   **General Actions:** What keys should be reserved for general application actions, such as:\n            *   Quitting the game/application? (e.g., `Esc`, `q`, `Ctrl+C`)\n            *   Returning to the main menu from a game? (e.g., `m`)\n            *   Restarting the current game? (e.g., `r`)\n        *   **Case Sensitivity:** Should the player input keys be case-sensitive (e.g., only 'q' not 'Q') or case-insensitive?\n\n5.  **Computer Difficulty Levels:**\n    *   **Requirement:** The computer opponent should have increasing difficulty across levels 1, 2, and 3.\n    *   **Clarification Questions:**\n        *   **Level 1 (Easy):** What specific behavior should the easy AI exhibit? (e.g., always make a random valid move?)\n        *   **Level 2 (Medium):** What specific behavior should the medium AI exhibit? (e.g., block immediate player wins, but otherwise make random moves? Or prioritize its own immediate wins?)\n        *   **Level 3 (Hard):** What specific behavior should the hard AI exhibit? (e.g., optimal play using an algorithm like Minimax, or a very strong heuristic-based approach?)\n\nPlease provide your answers to these questions so I can proceed with the implementation plan.\n",
