  "reply": "Here's a step-by-step development plan for your TUI Snake game in Rust:\n\n1.  **Project Initialization**: Create a new Rust project using `cargo new snake_tui`.\n2.  **Dependency Management**: Add a TUI library (e.g., `crossterm`) and potentially a random number generator (`rand`) to `Cargo.toml`.\n3.  **Game State Definition**:\n    *   Define structs for `Snake` (body segments, direction), `Food` (position), `Game` (board dimensions, score, game over status).\n    *   Implement methods for `Snake` movement, growth, and collision checks.\n4.  **TUI Setup**:\n    *   Initialize `crossterm` for raw mode, hide cursor, and clear screen.\n    *   Set up event polling for keyboard input.\n5.  **Main Game Loop**:\n    *   A continuous loop that:\n        *   Handles user input to change snake direction or quit.\n        *   Updates the game state (move snake, check collisions, generate food).\n        *   Renders the game board, snake, food, and score to the terminal.\n        *   Introduces a small delay to control game speed.\n6.  **Input Handling**:\n    *   Process `crossterm` events for arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control the snake.\n    *   Handle 'q' or 'Esc' for quitting the game.\n7.  **Rendering Logic**:\n    *   Clear the terminal screen.\n    *   Draw borders for the game area.\n    *   Draw the snake segments.\n    *   Draw the food.\n    *   Display the current score and \"Game Over\" message if applicable.\n8.  **Game Logic Implementation**:\n    *   **Movement**: Update snake head position based on current direction, shift body segments.\n    *   **Food**: Generate food at a random valid position. Detect when the snake eats food, increase score, and grow the snake.\n    *   **Collision Detection**: Check for collisions with walls and the snake's own body.\n    *   **Game Over**: Set game over flag on collision.\n9.  **Cleanup**: Restore terminal to original state on exit.\n10. **Testing**: Implement basic unit tests for core game logic components (e.g., snake movement, collision detection).\n11. **Refinement**: Add features like difficulty levels, pause functionality, or improved aesthetics.\n",
