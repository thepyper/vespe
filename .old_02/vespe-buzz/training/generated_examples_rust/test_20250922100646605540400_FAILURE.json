  "hero_prompt": "Okay, here’s a user prompt designed to generate a natural and effective prompt for a language model to use the `read_file` tool for summarization, considering the specified scenario and tool specifications:\n\n“Okay, let’s say I need to quickly get a sense of what a long report on climate change is about. I’ve got a file with all the details – it’s about 50 pages long, so I need a concise summary. Could you use the `read_file` tool to pull out the key takeaways from that report?  Specifically, I want to focus on the main arguments and findings, and keep it relatively casual – like I’m explaining it to a colleague.  Let’s aim for a medium context length, so I can really understand the core of the document.  Please use a casual tone.”\n\n---\n\n**Explanation of why this prompt works:**\n\n*   **Realistic Scenario:** It starts with a relatable scenario (summarizing a long report).\n*   **Specific Use Case:** Clearly states the goal – summarization.\n*   **Complexity:**  Acknowledges the length of the file, prompting for a concise summary.\n*   **Context Length:**  Mentions the context length, guiding the model to provide a focused summary.\n*   **Style:**  Requests a casual tone, which is important for a natural interaction.\n*   **Natural Language:** Avoids overly formal instructions.\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to refine this further!",
  "hero_response": "That’s a fantastic prompt! It’s well-structured and directly addresses the requirements. Here are a few minor tweaks and refinements, leaning into making it even *more* effective for a language model:\n\n**Option 1 (Slightly more directive):**\n\n“Okay, let’s say I need to quickly get a sense of what a long report on climate change is about.

Let’s aim for a medium context length, so I can really understand the core of the document.  Please use a casual tone, and ideally, provide a summary that’s roughly 200-300 words long.  Don’t just list the points; synthesize them into a coherent overview.”\n\n**Why these are improvements:**\n\n*   **Emphasis on Synthesis:** Adding \"don’t just list the points; synthesize them into a coherent overview\" encourages the model to go beyond simple extraction.\n*   **Length Guidance:** Specifying a word count (200-300 words) provides a more concrete target.\n*   **Tone Reinforcement:** Explicitly asking for a \"casual tone\" reinforces the desired style.\n\nUltimately, your original prompt is excellent. These are just refinements to potentially nudge the model even further in the right direction.  Which option do you think is best, or would you like me to explore a different approach?",
