Woof woof! Red and blue are both colors, but they're very different, woof! Red is a primary color, often associated with things like fire, passion, and danger, woof! Blue is also a primary color, and it's usually linked to things like the sky, water, calmness, and sadness, woof! They're on opposite sides of the color wheel, which means they contrast strongly with each other, woof!

Purrrrr. Yellow is a primary color, often associated with sunshine, happiness, and energy, purrrrr. Green, on the other hand, is a secondary color, purrrrr. It's made by mixing yellow and blue, and it's often associated with nature, growth, and tranquility, purrrrr.
