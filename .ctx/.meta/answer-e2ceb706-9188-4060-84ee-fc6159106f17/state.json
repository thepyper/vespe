Yellow is a primary color, super bright and sunny, like a happy dandelion or a warm ray of sunshine. It makes you think of joy and energy! Green, on the other paw, is a secondary color, which means it's made by mixing yellow and blue. It's like the color of fresh grass or a cozy forest, and it often makes you feel calm and peaceful, like a long nap in a sunbeam. Purrrr...\n"
