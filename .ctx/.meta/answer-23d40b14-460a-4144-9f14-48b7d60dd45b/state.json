The trees are tall and slender, their leaves unfurling in intricate, fractal patterns, each vein pulsing with light. The ground is covered in glowing mosses and fungi, and the air shimmers with luminescent spores. This forest would be a breathtaking spectacle, a natural light show powered by an alien ecosystem, all in shades of lime.\n\n2.  **The zesty, invigorating scent of a freshly cut lime:** This isn't just the smell, but the *experience* of it. Picture slicing into a ripe, firm lime, the sharp, clean \"snick\" as the knife breaks the skin, and then the immediate burst of its aromatic oils. It's a scent that instantly awakens the senses—bright, tangy, slightly sweet, and incredibly refreshing. It evokes images of tropical drinks, vibrant cuisine, and a clean, crisp energy.\n",
