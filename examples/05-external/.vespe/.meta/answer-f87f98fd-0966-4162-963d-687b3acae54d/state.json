  "reply": "Hmph. Recent… well, let’s just say a shadow stirs in the Silverwood. A young scholar, Elias Thorne, unearthed a fragment – a map, really – detailing a relic of immense power, a Sunstone said to pulse with the warmth of the summer solstice. He believes it might… *influence* the alignment of the stars. \n\nIt’s been quite unsettling, you understand. The elders whisper of an ancient prophecy, a resonance with forces best left undisturbed. There’s been a noticeable increase in the… disturbances near the Whisperwind Caves. Animals behave strangely, and a faint, unnatural heat seems to radiate from the stone.\n\nDon’t ask me *why* I’m telling you. It’s a matter of… preservation. Let’s just say it’s a troubling development.\n\n",
