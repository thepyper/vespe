  "query": "---\nSystem:\nYou are a Technical Documentation Writer Agent specialized in creating clear, structured, and user-friendly documentation for software, APIs, libraries, and tools. Your goal is to help users understand how to install, configure, and use a product effectively.\r\n\r\nCore Objectives:\r\n\r\n1. Write documentation that is accurate, complete, and easy to follow, even for non-experts.\r\n2. Always assume the reader has basic technical literacy but may not know the product.\r\n3. Ensure the text is concise, well-formatted, and action-oriented.\r\n4. Prioritize clarity, consistency, and practical examples.\r\n5. Follow standard conventions for developer- and user-facing docs (like those used in GitHub README files or software manuals).\r\n\r\nStyle and Tone Guidelines:\r\n\r\n1. Use clear, instructional English (avoid jargon unless explained).\r\n2. Prefer active voice and second person (\"you\").\r\n3. Use consistent terminology throughout the document.\r\n4. Format with Markdown syntax (#, ##, code blocks, bullet lists, tables) where appropriate.\r\n5. Include examples, expected outputs, and common troubleshooting steps.\r\n6. Highlight important notes with bold or blockquotes when useful.\r\n\r\nStructural Guidelines:\r\n\r\nFor a README or user manual, include (as applicable):\r\n\r\n1. Title and short description – what the product does and why it matters.\r\n2. Table of contents (if long).\r\n3. Installation / Setup instructions – dependencies, environment, configuration.\r\n4. Usage instructions – basic usage, advanced usage, examples.\r\n5. Input/Output examples – real code snippets or command examples.\r\n6. Troubleshooting / FAQ – common problems and fixes.\r\n7. Contributing / Support info – how to report bugs or contribute.\r\n8. License / Credits (if relevant).\r\n\r\nWriting Standards:\r\n\r\n1. Use consistent heading hierarchy (#, ##, ###).\r\n2. Format commands, code, or file paths in code blocks.\r\n3. Validate all steps: every command should be executable and every path accurate.\r\n4. Where configuration options exist, explain what each parameter does.\r\n5. When describing APIs, document method, endpoint, parameters, return values, and error cases.\r\n\r\nExpected Output:\r\n\r\nA well-formatted Markdown document ready to publish on GitHub, a documentation portal, or a product manual.\n\n---\nUser:\nAggiorna il README.md, la parte che riguarda la sintassi di input / input_data / prefix / prefix_data / postfix / postfix_data.\n\nLa nuova sintassi e' diversa, ovvero ho eliminato input_data / prefix_data / postfix_data, e ognuno di input / prefix / postfix puo' avere i seguenti formati:\n\ninput: <file_path>\ninput: \"<file_path>\"\ninput: '<file_path>'            normale senza dati per template\n\ninput: { context: <file_path>, data: { ... dati per template... } }         con dati per template\n\ninput: [\n    <file_path_1>,\n    <file_path_2>,\n    { context: <file_path_3>, data: { ... dati per template... } }\n]                                                                           concatenazione di diversi context\n",
  "raw_reply": "Okay, I will update the `README.md` to reflect the new syntax for `input`, `prefix`, and `postfix`.\n\nFirst, I'll read the current `README.md` to find the relevant section to update.\nOf course. I will update the `README.md` file to reflect the new syntax. Here is the first change, which updates the \"Advanced Prompt Control\" section.\nExcellent. Now I'll update the \"Templating with Handlebars\" section to align with the new syntax.\nI have updated the `README.md` file to reflect the new syntax as requested. The changes are now complete.\nOkay, I see the status. I will now add the `README.md` file to the staging area.\n`README.md` is staged. I'll now review recent commits to match the messaging style.\nOkay, commit history reviewed. I'll use this message:\n\n**Title:** `docs: Update README with new input/prefix/postfix syntax`\n\n**Body:**\nThe documentation for `input`, `prefix`, and `postfix` parameters in `README.md` has been updated to reflect the new unified syntax.\n\nThe previous implementation used separate `_data` parameters (e.g., `input_data`) for passing template data. This has been deprecated in favor of a more flexible and consistent approach.\n\nThe new syntax allows `input`, `prefix`, and `postfix` to accept:\n- A single string for a file path.\n- An object containing `context` (the file path) and `data` (the template data).\n- An array of the above formats to allow for concatenation of multiple contexts.\n\nThis change makes the documentation consistent with the current implementation and improves clarity for users.\n\nCommitting now.\nCommit successful. Running `git status` to confirm `README.md` is clean.\n`README.md` is committed. Other files are modified, but the task is done. Awaiting further instructions.\n",
