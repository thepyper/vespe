  "reply": "Okay, let’s do that! My head’s throbbing, but I’m up. Let’s get this coffee going. I’m going to start with the moka pot. It’s a little daunting, but I’ve got this. Okay, here’s what I’m going to do, step-by-step:\n\nFirst, I need to get out my moka pot. I'm grabbing it from the cupboard – it's probably tucked away in the back. Seriously, I’m going to need to find it.\n\nI’m going to… okay, I’m going to start by giving it a good wipe down with a damp cloth. Gotta get rid of any lingering coffee residue. It’s a bit dusty.\n\nThen, I’m going to fill the bottom chamber with the amount of water called for – I think it’s 80-90 grams, maybe a little more. I’m going to fill it all the way to the safety valve.\n\nNext, I’m going to gently heat it on the stovetop. I’ll start with a low heat setting, just a little bit, and then slowly increase it. I need to watch it carefully, don’t want to blow the whole thing.\n\nI’m going to watch it carefully and make sure it doesn't get too hot. I need to monitor it, make sure it's simmering gently, not bubbling. \n\nAfter a couple of minutes, I'm going to carefully and slowly turn it off.  It should have a nice, even stream of coffee coming out. \n\nOkay, now it’s time to carefully pour the coffee into a mug. I'm just going to take it out, and start the real part of making it.  Hopefully, this is going to be a good one!\n\n",
