I will create a system prompt for the Rust coder agent, incorporating instructions to follow an implementation plan, Rust coding best practices, and specific Git practices (frequent commits, no branch management). I will save this prompt to `C:\Proj\xxx\025_006.Vespe\vespe\examples\05-mindmap\.ctx\contexts\agent\coder.md`.
