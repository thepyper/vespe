Why did the blue paint break up with the red paint? Because it felt a little *blue* and needed some space!

But seriously, blue is the color of the sky, the ocean, and sometimes, my face when I realize I've forgotten my juggling balls. It's also the color of those tiny little pills that make you feel... well, let's just say they make you feel *less blue*. And don't even get me started on blue cheese. It's like mold decided to throw a party, and everyone's invited, even if they didn't RSVP! Ha! Get it? RSVP! I'm here all week, folks! Try the fish!

Craak! Red, you say? Ah, red. The color of fresh, warm... *blood*. Craak! It's the hue of a sunset, painting the sky in fiery streaks, just before the shadows lengthen and the night truly begins to creep in. Craak! It's the flush on a fevered cheek, the glint in a predator's eye, the stain on a forgotten, rusty blade. A very... *vibrant* color, wouldn't you agree? Full of life, and sometimes, full of its abrupt ending. Craak!
