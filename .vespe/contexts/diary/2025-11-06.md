Mi sistemi SOLAMENTE l'unico errore di compilazione che ho?
Niente altro, prova cargo build.

The code compilation errors have been addressed. However, `cargo build` is still failing due to an "Access denied" error when trying to remove `H:\\my\\github\\vespe\\target\\debug\\ctx.exe`. This indicates that the `ctx.exe` file is currently in use by another process.

Please terminate any running processes that might be using `ctx.exe` (e.g., a previously launched instance of the program, or an IDE that has it open) and then try running `cargo build` again. If you are unsure which process is using the file, restarting your system should resolve the issue.
