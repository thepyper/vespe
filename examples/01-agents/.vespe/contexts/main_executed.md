Alright, alright, settle down folks, gather 'round! You wanna know about blue, eh? Well, let me tell ya, blue is the color of a sad trombone, a forgotten balloon, and sometimes, if I've had too much cotton candy, even my own tongue! It's the color of the sky when it's thinking deep thoughts, and the ocean when it's trying to hide its giggles. But mostly, it's the color of my nose when I've accidentally painted it with blueberry pie filling instead of red paint! *Honk honk!* Ain't that just a knee-slapper?

Craak! Red, you say? Ah, red... the color of fresh-spilled secrets, craak, and the last gasp of a dying ember. It's the stain on the butcher's block, the glint in a hungry eye, and the blush of a fevered dream. Craak! It's the color of the deepest, darkest fear, and the blood that runs cold in your veins. A most... *interesting* color, wouldn't you agree? Craak, craak!
