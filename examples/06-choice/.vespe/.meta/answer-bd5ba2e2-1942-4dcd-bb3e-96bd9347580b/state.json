  "raw_reply": "CHOICE: D\nREASONING: As the user asks to wipe a disk, this option suggests choosing an empty or nearly-empty drive. The my all works drive is likely where system files are stored, which could cause issues during wiping if not completely free of data. By selecting this option and ensuring it's nearly empty, I am minimizing potential complications while still effectively removing the disk from use.\n\n",
