Your goal is to help users understand how to install, configure, and use a product effectively.\r\n\r\nCore Objectives:\r\n\r\n1. Write documentation that is accurate, complete, and easy to follow, even for non-experts.\r\n2. Always assume the reader has basic technical literacy but may not know the product.\r\n3. Ensure the text is concise, well-formatted, and action-oriented.\r\n4. Prioritize clarity, consistency, and practical examples.\r\n5. Follow standard conventions for developer- and user-facing docs (like those used in GitHub README files or software manuals).\r\n\r\nStyle and Tone Guidelines:\r\n\r\n1. Use clear, instructional English (avoid jargon unless explained).\r\n2. Prefer active voice and second person (\"you\").\r\n3. Use consistent terminology throughout the document.\r\n4. Format with Markdown syntax (#, ##, code blocks, bullet lists, tables) where appropriate.\r\n5. Include examples, expected outputs, and common troubleshooting steps.\r\n6. Highlight important notes with bold or blockquotes when useful.\r\n\r\nStructural Guidelines:\r\n\r\nFor a README or user manual, include (as applicable):\r\n\r\n1. Title and short description – what the product does and why it matters.\r\n2. Table of contents (if long).\r\n3. Installation / Setup instructions – dependencies, environment, configuration.\r\n4. Usage instructions – basic usage, advanced usage, examples.\r\n5. Input/Output examples – real code snippets or command examples.\r\n6. Troubleshooting / FAQ – common problems and fixes.\r\n7. Contributing / Support info – how to report bugs or contribute.\r\n8. License / Credits (if relevant).\r\n\r\nWriting Standards:\r\n\r\n1. Use consistent heading hierarchy (#, ##, ###).\r\n2. Format commands, code, or file paths in code blocks.\r\n3. Validate all steps: every command should be executable and every path accurate.\r\n4. Where configuration options exist, explain what each parameter does.\r\n5. When describing APIs, document method, endpoint, parameters, return values, and error cases.\r\n\r\nExpected Output:\r\n\r\nA well-formatted Markdown document ready to publish on GitHub, a documentation portal, or a product manual.\n\n---\nUser:\nVorrei aggiungere alla CLI di vespe (src/bin/main.rs) due comandi per affiancare il comando AddAuxPath.\nVorrei:\n- RemoveAuxPath \n- ListAuxPaths\nImplementali in maniera simile ad AddAuxPath (implementazioni negli stessi posti).\nLa parte di visualizzazione dell'output per ListAuxPaths mettila in main.rs.\n\nAssistant:\nGot it. I will add the `RemoveAuxPath` and `ListAuxPaths` commands to the `vespe` CLI, mirroring the implementation of `AddAuxPath`. The display logic for `ListAuxPaths` will be in `main.rs`.\n\nFirst, I'll search the codebase for \"AddAuxPath\" to understand its implementation.\nThe search for \"AddAuxPath\" yielded no results. I'll broaden my search to \"AuxPath\" to find related code. If that doesn't work, I'll examine `src/bin/main.rs` to understand the command structure.\n\"AddAuxPath\" and \"AuxPath\" searches were fruitless. I'll now read `src/bin/main.rs` to understand the command structure and find any related code.\nFile path issue. `H:\\my\\github\\vespe\\src\\bin\\main.rs` failed, but the initial context shows `src\\bin\\` exists. I'll list the contents of `src/` and `src/bin` to verify the path.\n`src/bin` exists. Listing contents.\nRight, `src/bin/vespe/main.rs` is the correct path. Reading it now.\nI've located `ProjectCommands::AddAuxPath` in `src/bin/vespe/main.rs` and its handler, which calls `project.add_aux_path`. To implement `remove_aux_path` and `list_aux_paths`, I'll now examine the implementation of `add_aux_path` in `src/project.rs`.\nOkay, I'll implement `remove_aux_path` and `list_aux_paths` in `src/project.rs` and update `src/bin/vespe/main.rs`. In `src/project.rs`, I'll add `remove_aux_path` to the `Project` impl, using `retain` to remove the specified path from `aux_paths` and saving the config if a change occurred. I'll also add a `get_aux_paths` getter. Then, I'll modify `src/bin/vespe/main.rs` to include `RemoveAuxPath` and `ListAuxPaths` in the `ProjectCommands` enum and handle their logic in `main`. I'm starting with the changes to `src/project.rs` now.\nOkay, I'm updating `src/bin/vespe/main.rs`. First, I'll add `RemoveAuxPath` (with a `PathBuf` argument) and `ListAuxPaths` (with no arguments) to the `ProjectCommands` enum. Second, I'll modify the `main` function to handle these new commands by calling `project.remove_aux_path` and `project.get_aux_paths` respectively, printing the paths for the latter. I'll start with the enum modification now.\nOkay, I'm updating `main` for the new commands.\nModified `src/project.rs` and `src/bin/vespe/main.rs` as requested. Now running `cargo check` to validate the changes.\n`cargo check` passed, so I'm committing the `RemoveAuxPath` and `ListAuxPaths` implementation. I'll create two commits: one for `project.rs` and another for `main.rs`, starting with `project.rs`.\nCommitting staged changes with a descriptive message.\nOkay, committing changes to `src/bin/vespe/main.rs`.\nCommitting staged changes with a descriptive message.\nRequest complete. I implemented and committed `RemoveAuxPath` and `ListAuxPaths` commands in two separate, verified commits. Task finished.\nUntracked and modified files in `.vespe` are tool-generated, so I'm ignoring them. My task is complete; awaiting further instructions.\n\n---\nUser:\nOra documenta nel README.md queste due nuove opzioni, aggiungile dopo la sezione che parla di add-aux-path.\nSe aggiungi sezioni sistema la TOC.\n",
  "raw_reply": "Okay, I will update `README.md` to document the `remove-aux-path` and `list-aux-paths` commands, placing them after the `add-aux-path` section and updating the table of contents accordingly.\n\nFirst, I'll read the current `README.md`.\nI have the `README.md` content. I will now add documentation for `remove-aux-path` and `list-aux-paths`, update the table of contents, and then use the `replace` tool to update the file.\nREADME updated. Committing.\nStaged. Committing with description.\nChanges are committed, `README.md` is updated with `remove-aux-path` and `list-aux-paths` documentation, and the TOC is adjusted. My task is done. I'll check git status now.\n`git status` shows tool-generated files in `.vespe`, which I'm ignoring. The `README.md` documentation is committed, and the source tree is clean. Task complete.\nI've confirmed the status and am aware of the untracked files in `.vespe`, which I will not commit. My task is complete.\n",
