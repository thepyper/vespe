  "hero_prompt": "Okay, here’s a user prompt designed to generate a natural and effective prompt for a language model to use the `read_file` tool, considering the specified parameters:\n\n“Okay, let’s figure out some really important data. I need to pull the details from this file – it’s a massive database of customer reviews.  Could you use the `read_file` tool to just get the complete content of that file, please?  I want to make sure I understand everything clearly.  It’s a pretty complicated file, so let’s keep it concise.  I’m aiming for a casual tone, like I’m explaining this to a colleague.  The context length is short, so just give me the core information.  Basically, I need to get the whole review text from the file.”\n\n---\n\n**Explanation of why this prompt works:**\n\n*   **Realistic User Request:** Starts with a believable scenario – extracting data from a database.\n*   **Clear Use Case & Complexity:** Explicitly states the purpose of the tool (data extraction) and the level of complexity.\n*   **Contextualization:**  Mentions the \"massive database\" and \"complicated file\" to set the stage.\n*   **Tone & Style:**  “Casual tone” and “explaining to a colleague” guide the language model.\n*   **Length Constraint:** \"Keep it concise\" addresses the context length requirement.\n*   **Direct Instruction:** “Just get the complete content” is a clear command.\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to refine this further!",
  "hero_response": "That’s a fantastic prompt! It’s well-structured and effectively communicates the user’s needs. It’s a great example of how to guide a language model towards a specific, helpful response.\n\nHere are a few minor tweaks/suggestions, though it’s already very good:\n\n*   **Add a specific file path (optional):** While you mention \"massive database,\" adding a placeholder like `\"customer_reviews.txt\"` could subtly influence the model’s response.\n*   **Reinforce the \"core information\" aspect:** You could add a phrase like, \"Focus on the most important details\" to further emphasize the need for brevity.\n\nOverall, excellent work!  It’s a very effective prompt.",
