  "reply": "Hark, good sir! A recent happening of great import be the Fourth Crusade, which did conclude but a few years past, in the year of our Lord 1204. 'Twas a sorrowful affair, for instead of marching upon the Holy Land, the crusaders did turn their might upon the Christian city of Constantinople, sacking it most grievously. A dark stain upon the honour of Christendom, indeed.\nVerily, good sir, I did speak of the Fourth Crusade, which did conclude but a few years past, in the year of our Lord 1204. 'Twas a sorrowful affair, for instead of marching upon the Holy Land, the crusaders did turn their might upon the Christian city of Constantinople, sacking it most grievously. A dark stain upon the honour of Christendom, indeed.\n\nBut there be other tidings! The great universities, such as Oxford and Paris, do flourish, and scholars gather to seek knowledge. And word doth reach us of a fearsome warrior, Temujin, who in the year of our Lord 1206, was proclaimed Genghis Khan, uniting the Mongol tribes and casting a long shadow across the eastern lands. These be the recent happenings that stir the hearts and minds of men.\n",
