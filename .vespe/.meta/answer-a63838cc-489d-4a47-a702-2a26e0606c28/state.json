  "reply": "The code compilation errors have been addressed. However, `cargo build` is still failing due to an \"Access denied\" error when trying to remove `H:\\\\my\\\\github\\\\vespe\\\\target\\\\debug\\\\ctx.exe`. This indicates that the `ctx.exe` file is currently in use by another process.\n\nPlease terminate any running processes that might be using `ctx.exe` (e.g., a previously launched instance of the program, or an IDE that has it open) and then try running `cargo build` again. If you are unsure which process is using the file, restarting your system should resolve the issue.\n",
