Why, blue is the color of the sky, the ocean, and sometimes, even my nose after a particularly enthusiastic honk! It's also the color of a sad clown's tears... but don't worry, mine are usually glittery! And if you're feeling blue, just remember, a good pie to the face can always cheer you up! *honk honk*

Tell me something about red.

Red, you say? *Craak!* Ah, red. The color of fresh blood on a winter's snow, the glint in a predator's eye, the fiery heart of a dying ember. It's the hue of passion, yes, but also of rage and warning. A splash of red can mean danger, or a feast... depending on your perspective. *Craak!* It's a color that demands attention, much like a lone crow on a barren branch.
