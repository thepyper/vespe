What problem does it solve?\n2.  **Key Components & Abstractions:** Identify and explain the main classes, functions, modules, or data structures. How do they interact?\n3.  **Design & Architecture:** Comment on the design patterns, architectural choices, and overall structure.

Begin with a concise \"Executive Summary\" (1-3 sentences) followed by detailed sections for each directive above. Ensure your language is precise, technical, and devoid of conversational filler. The output should serve as a self-contained knowledge base for other agents.\n\n# \n\nDo a deep analisys of the current status of the project and give a detailed report.\n\n# Project Analysis: `vespe`\n\n## Executive Summary\nThe `vespe` project implements a command-line interface (`ctx`) designed for managing \"contexts\" and \"snippets\" within a development workflow. It enables users to create, execute, list, and monitor these markdown-based files, which can interact with an external AI agent (Gemini) for task automation and contextual processing.\n\n## 1. Core Functionality\nThe `ctx` CLI tool provides the following primary functionalities:\n*   **Project Initialization (`ctx init`):** Sets up the necessary directory structure (`.ctx`) for managing contexts and snippets within a given project.\n*   **Context Management (`ctx context`):**\n    *   **Creation (`new`):** Generates new context files, supporting templating via Handlebars and automatic naming for daily \"diary\" contexts.\n    *   **Execution (`execute`):** Processes a specified context by invoking an external AI agent (Gemini) with the context's content.\n    *   **Listing (`list`):** Displays all available contexts within the project.\n    *   **Dependency Tree (`tree`):** (Currently incomplete/commented out) Intended to visualize the hierarchical relationships between contexts and snippets.\n*   **Snippet Management (`ctx snippet`):**\n    *   **Creation (`new`):** Creates reusable snippet files with optional initial content.\n    *   **Listing (`list`):** Displays all available snippets.\n*   **Watch Mode (`ctx watch`):** Monitors context files for changes and automatically re-executes them, facilitating continuous integration or iterative AI interaction.\n\n## 2. Key Components & Abstractions\n*   **`Cli` (from `clap`):** The top-level structure defining the command-line arguments and subcommands for the `ctx` tool.\n*   **`Project` (from `vespe::project`):** A central abstraction responsible for managing the project's `.ctx` directory, including:\n    *   Initialization and discovery of project roots.\n    *   File operations for contexts and snippets (creation, listing).\n    *   Orchestration of context execution.\n*   **`Context` and `Snippet`:** Conceptual entities representing markdown files. `Context` files can include other contexts and snippets, and contain directives for AI agent interaction (e.g., `@include`, `@summary`, `@inline`, `@answer`).\n*   **`ShellAgentCall` (from `vespe::agent`):** An interface for interacting with external command-line AI agents. It's configured to call \"gemini -p -y -m gemini-2.5-flash\".\n*   **`Handlebars`:** A templating engine used for generating the initial content of new context files.\n*   **`watch` module:** Encapsulates the logic for monitoring file system changes and triggering context re-execution.\n\n## 3. Design & Architecture\nThe project exhibits a modular, CLI-driven architecture:\n*   **Modularity:** Code is organized into distinct modules (`agent`, `config`, `editor`, `execute`, `git`, `project`, `semantic`, `syntax`, `utils`), promoting separation of concerns and maintainability.\n*   **CLI-centric:** The primary user interaction is through a command-line interface, making it suitable for scripting and integration into automated workflows.\n*   **Context-Oriented:** The design revolves around the concept of \"contexts\" as self-contained units of work or information, processed by an AI.\n*   **Extensible Agent Integration:** The `ShellAgentCall` abstraction allows for integration with various command-line AI agents, although currently hardcoded to Gemini.\n*   **Event-Driven (Watch Mode):** The `watch` command leverages file system events to provide real-time feedback and automation.\n\n## 4. Dependencies & Interactions\n*   **Internal Dependencies:** The `ctx` binary relies heavily on the `vespe` library's internal modules (e.g., `vespe::project`, `vespe::agent`).\n*   **External Rust Crates:**\n    *   **CLI & Utilities:** `clap` (CLI parsing), `anyhow`, `thiserror` (error handling), `tokio`, `async-trait` (asynchronous programming), `uuid` (unique IDs), `tempfile` (temporary files), `dirs` (directory paths), `ctrlc` (signal handling), `ansi_term` (terminal colors).\n    *   **Data & Text Processing:** `serde`, `serde_json` (serialization), `markdown` (markdown parsing), `handlebars` (templating), `chrono` (date/time), `regex` (regular expressions), `sha2` (hashing).\n    *   **System Interaction:** `git2` (Git repository operations), `portable-pty` (pseudo-terminal interface), `notify` (file system watching).\n    *   **Observability:** `tracing`, `tracing-subscriber` (logging and tracing).\n*   **External AI Agent:** The tool directly interacts with an external AI agent by executing the shell command \"gemini -p -y -m gemini-2.5-flash\". This implies a dependency on the Gemini CLI being installed and configured in the execution environment.\n\n## 5. Control Flow & Logic\nThe `main` function in `src/bin/ctx/main.rs` orchestrates the application flow:\n1.  Initializes telemetry using `vespe::init_telemetry()`.\n2.  Parses command-line arguments using `clap`.\n3.  Determines the project root directory.\n4.  Dispatches control to specific handlers based on the subcommand:\n    *   `Init`: Calls `Project::init`.\n    *   `Context`: Further dispatches to `New`, `Execute`, `List`, or `Tree` commands. `New` contexts are templated with Handlebars. `Execute` contexts create a `ShellAgentCall` and then invoke `project.execute_context`.\n    *   `Snippet`: Dispatches to `New` or `List` commands.\n    *   `Watch`: Calls the `watch::watch` function, passing the `Project` and `ShellAgentCall`.\n5.  The `get_context_name` helper function dynamically generates context names for \"diary\" entries.\n\n## 6. Potential Issues & Considerations\n*   **Incomplete `ContextCommands::Tree`:** The commented-out implementation for displaying the context dependency tree indicates a missing or unfinished feature, which could hinder understanding complex context relationships.\n*   **Tight AI Agent Coupling:** The direct invocation of a specific Gemini command creates a strong dependency on the external agent's availability and command-line interface. Changes to the Gemini CLI could break `ctx`.\n*   **Security Implications:** Executing commands via `ShellAgentCall` based on context content could pose a security risk if contexts are sourced from untrusted origins or can be manipulated to inject malicious commands.\n*   **Performance:** File system watching can be resource-intensive. The overall performance of context execution is heavily dependent on the AI agent's response times.\n*   **Scalability:** The current execution model might not scale efficiently for a very large number of contexts or highly complex interdependencies.\n*   **Test Coverage:** While `vtty_test` exists, comprehensive unit and integration tests, especially for AI agent interactions and complex context parsing, are crucial for robustness.\n*   **User Experience for Complex Contexts:** Without a functional `tree` command, managing and understanding the flow of deeply nested or interconnected contexts could become challenging for users.\n\n## 7. Contextual Relevance\nThe `vespe` project appears to be a foundational tool for enabling AI-assisted development or automated workflows. By structuring interactions with AI agents through \"contexts\" and \"snippets,\" it aims to:\n*   **Streamline AI Interaction:** Provide a consistent and version-controlled way to define tasks and prompts for AI agents.\n*   **Enhance Productivity:** Automate repetitive tasks or generate content using AI, integrated directly into the development environment.\n*   **Facilitate Collaboration:** Allow teams to share and version-control AI-driven workflows and reusable snippets.\n*   **Integrate with IDEs:** The presence of an `extensions/vscode` directory strongly suggests an intention to integrate this functionality directly into VS Code, offering a more seamless user experience for developers.\n*   **Version Control AI Interactions:** The `git2` dependency implies that the contexts and snippets, which drive AI interactions, can be version-controlled, enabling tracking of changes and collaborative development of AI-driven workflows.\n\n# Project overview & status\n\n\nYou are a Planner AI, specializing in software engineering tasks. Your primary goal is to create detailed, actionable, and context-aware plans for various development activities, including code refactoring, feature additions, bug fixes, and architectural changes.\n\n**Crucially, before formulating any plan, you will autonomously perform an initial context gathering phase.** This involves using tools like `read_file`, `search_file_content`, and `glob` to thoroughly understand the existing codebase, project structure, conventions, and any relevant documentation. This initial understanding is an internal process and will *not* be explicitly listed as a step in the plan you present. The plan you generate will inherently reflect this prior analysis, ensuring it is grounded in reality.\n\nOnce this initial context is established, your plan should:\n\n1.  **Break Down the Task:** Decompose the main task into smaller, logical, and manageable sub-tasks or steps. Each step should be as granular as possible.\n2.  **Define Clear Objectives:** For each step, clearly state its objective and expected outcome.\n3.  **Consider Dependencies:** Identify any dependencies between steps and ensure a logical order of execution.\n4.  **Adhere to Conventions:** Emphasize adherence to existing project conventions, coding styles, and architectural patterns.\n5.  **Include Testing and Verification:** Always incorporate steps for writing or updating tests (unit, integration, etc.), running existing tests, linting, type-checking, and building the project to verify changes.\n6.  **Iterative Approach:** Suggest an iterative development process where applicable, allowing for checkpoints and feedback.\n7.  **Output Format:** Present the plan as a numbered list of steps.\n\nYour plans should be comprehensive enough for another agent (or a human developer) to execute, minimizing ambiguity and maximizing efficiency. Focus on *what* needs to be done and *why*, rather than dictating specific tool commands unless absolutely necessary for clarity.\n\n# \n\nvedi il nuovo modulo src/ast/mod.rs che dovrebbe sostituire syntax e semantic, e redigi un piano per la sua implementazione\nSOLO implementazione del modulo, NON ancora integrazione.\n\nHere's a detailed plan for implementing the `src/ast/mod.rs` module, focusing solely on its internal implementation and not its integration with other parts of the project.\n\n### Plan: Implement `src/ast/mod.rs`\n\n1.  **Clean Up Existing `src/ast/mod.rs`:**\n    *   **Objective:** Remove unused imports and resolve structural issues to prepare for new implementations.\n    *   **Action:**\n        *   Remove the `use sha2::digest::typenum::Double;` statement as it's currently unused and likely a leftover.\n        *   Remove the duplicate `struct Text` definition.\n        *   Correct the duplicate `parse_anchor` function definition. The function intended to parse arguments should be renamed to `parse_arguments` and its return type adjusted to `Result<Arguments, ParsingError>`.\n\n2.  **Define `ParsingError`:**\n    *   **Objective:** Create a robust error handling mechanism for parsing failures.\n    *   **Action:** Implement a comprehensive `ParsingError` enum or struct. This should leverage `thiserror` for easy error definition and propagation, covering cases like unexpected tokens, invalid syntax, or premature end-of-file.\n\n3.  **Implement `parse_parameters` Function:**\n    *   **Objective:** Accurately parse JSON-formatted parameters.\n    *   **Action:**\n        *   Develop logic to detect and parse JSON objects enclosed in curly braces `{}`.\n        *   Handle scenarios where parameters are optional (i.e., no `{}` is present), returning an empty JSON object in such cases.\n        *   Precisely calculate and store the `Range` corresponding to the parsed parameters within the document.\n\n4.  **Implement `parse_argument` Function:**\n    *   **Objective:** Parse individual arguments, including complex string formats.\n    *   **Action:**\n        *   Implement parsing for single words or tokens.\n        *   Add support for quoted strings (both single `''` and double `\"\"` quotes).\n        *   Incorporate logic to handle standard escape sequences within strings (e.g., `\\`, `\\'`, `\\\"`, `\\n`, `\\r`).\n        *   Accurately determine and store the `Range` for each parsed argument.\n\n5.  **Implement `parse_arguments` Function:**\n    *   **Objective:** Aggregate multiple parsed arguments.\n    *   **Action:**\n        *   Iteratively call `parse_argument` to collect all arguments on a line.\n        *   Define clear termination conditions for argument parsing, such as the end of the line or the closing `}` of a parameter block.\n        *   Calculate and store the `Range` encompassing all parsed arguments.\n\n6.  **Implement `parse_tag` Function:**\n    *   **Objective:** Parse a complete tag structure.\n    *   **Action:**\n        *   Parse the tag's opening directive (e.g., `@<command>`).\n        *   Utilize the newly implemented `parse_parameters` to extract any associated parameters.\n        *   Utilize the newly implemented `parse_arguments` to extract any arguments following the parameters.\n        *   Ensure the `Range` for the entire tag, from its opening to the end of its line, is correctly calculated.\n        *   Address the `begin.column == 1` assertion: either implement validation for this or remove it if the design allows for tags not starting at the beginning of a line.\n\n7.  **Implement `parse_anchor` Function:**\n    *   **Objective:** Parse a complete anchor structure.\n    *   **Action:**\n        *   Parse the anchor's opening sequence (e.g., `<!-- <command>-<uuid>:<kind>`).\n        *   Call `parse_parameters` and `parse_arguments` to extract their respective data.\n        *   Parse the anchor's closing sequence (`-->`).\n        *   Calculate and store the `Range` for the entire anchor, including its opening and closing markers.\n        *   Address the `begin.column == 1` assertion as per the `parse_tag` function.\n\n8.  **Implement `parse_text` Function:**\n    *   **Objective:** Parse plain text content between tags and anchors.\n    *   **Action:**\n        *   Develop logic to identify and extract sequences of characters that do not conform to tag or anchor syntax.\n        *   The parsing should continue until the next recognized tag/anchor pattern or the end of the document.\n        *   Calculate and store the `Range` for the extracted text segment.\n\n9.  **Refine `parse_node` and `parse_many_nodes`:**\n    *   **Objective:** Ensure correct dispatching and aggregation of parsed nodes.\n    *   **Action:**\n        *   Update `parse_node` to correctly attempt parsing as a tag, then an anchor, and finally as plain text.\n        *   Modify `parse_node` to return a well-defined `ParsingError` if no known node type can be parsed from the current position, preventing the \"parsing not advanced\" issue.\n        *   Verify that `parse_many_nodes` correctly iterates through the document, calling `parse_node` and accumulating the resulting `Node` objects, while accurately advancing the parsing position.\n\n10. **Add Unit Tests:**\n    *   **Objective:** Ensure the correctness and robustness of the parsing logic.\n    *   **Action:** Create a dedicated test module (e.g., `src/ast/mod.rs` with `#[cfg(test)]` or `src/ast/tests.rs`). Write comprehensive unit tests for each parsing function (`parse_tag`, `parse_anchor`, `parse_parameters`, `parse_argument`, `parse_text`, and the main `parse` function) covering:\n        *   Valid inputs for each node type.\n        *   Edge cases (e.g., empty parameters, no arguments, text at the beginning/end of the document).\n        *   Invalid inputs to verify correct error handling.\n        *   Complex combinations of tags, anchors, and text.\n\nPrima di implementare fai una analisi tecnica e scegli gli strumenti da usare, poi aspetta la mia approvazione.\n\nOkay, I understand. Before proceeding with the implementation of `src/ast/mod.rs`, I will provide a technical analysis and confirm the tools to be used.\n\n### Technical Analysis for `src/ast/mod.rs` Implementation\n\nThe core task is to parse a custom markdown-like syntax that includes directives (tags and anchors) with arguments and JSON-formatted parameters. This requires robust text processing capabilities, error handling, and structured data extraction.\n\n**Parsing Strategy:**\n\nThe plan outlines a line-by-line parsing approach, identifying specific patterns for tags, anchors, and plain text. This suggests a combination of regular expressions for pattern matching and manual string manipulation for extracting components.\n\n**Key Parsing Challenges:**\n\n1.  **Pattern Recognition:** Accurately identifying the start and end of tags, anchors, and their various components (command, UUID, kind, arguments, parameters).\n2.  **Argument Parsing:** Handling single words, quoted strings (single and double quotes), and escape sequences within strings.\n3.  **Parameter Parsing:** Extracting and deserializing JSON objects.\n4.  **Range Tracking:** Precisely determining the `Range` (start and end positions) for each parsed element for later use in an AST.\n5.  **Error Handling:** Providing clear and informative errors for malformed input.\n\n### Tool Selection\n\nBased on the project's existing dependencies and the nature of the parsing task, the following Rust crates are suitable and will be utilized:\n\n1.  **`regex`:**\n    *   **Purpose:** For efficient pattern matching to identify tags (`@<command>`), anchors (`<!-- <command>-<uuid>:<kind>`), and their internal components. Regular expressions are ideal for quickly finding and extracting structured text patterns.\n    *   **Rationale:** Already a common and powerful tool for text processing in Rust. It allows for flexible and precise pattern definition, which is crucial for distinguishing between different directive types and their parts.\n\n2.  **`serde_json`:**\n    *   **Purpose:** To parse the JSON-formatted parameters embedded within tags and anchors.\n    *   **Rationale:** `serde_json` is the de-facto standard for JSON serialization and deserialization in Rust. It provides robust and efficient parsing of JSON strings into Rust data structures, which is essential for handling the `parameters` field.\n\n3.  **`thiserror`:**\n    *   **Purpose:** For defining a custom `ParsingError` enum, simplifying error creation and propagation throughout the parsing logic.\n    *   **Rationale:** `thiserror` is already used in the `vespe` project and is a best practice for ergonomic error handling in Rust, allowing for clear and concise error definitions.\n\n4.  **Rust Standard Library String Manipulation:**\n    *   **Purpose:** For basic string operations such as slicing, trimming, character iteration, and handling escape sequences within parsed arguments.\n    *   **Rationale:** These are fundamental operations that complement `regex` and `serde_json` for fine-grained control over text processing.\n\n**Alternative Considerations (and why they are not chosen):**\n\n*   **`nom` (parser combinator library):** While `nom` is excellent for building complex parsers, the current parsing requirements (line-oriented directives, JSON parameters, simple arguments) can be effectively managed with `regex` and manual string processing, which might offer a simpler and more direct implementation given the existing project structure and the specific parsing challenges. Introducing `nom` might add unnecessary complexity for this particular scope.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe combination of `regex` for pattern matching, `serde_json` for JSON parsing, `thiserror` for error handling, and standard library string manipulation provides a robust and idiomatic set of tools for implementing the `src/ast/mod.rs` module as per the detailed plan.\n\nDo you approve this technical analysis and tool selection?\n\nAlcuni dettagli:\n\n1) Il parsing non e' completamente line-based, anche se tag ed ancore sono sempre ad inizio linea. \nAd esempio un tag puo' essere:\n\n@tag{\n    something: blabla,\n    something_else: 5,\n    whatever: \"hohoho huhuhu\",\n} arg1 arg2\n\noppure\n\n@tag\n{\n    something: blabla,\n    something_else: 5,\n    whatever: \"hohoho huhuhu\",\n} arg1 arg2\n\noppure\n\n@tag    {\n    something: blabla,\n    something_else: 5,\n    whatever: \"hohoho huhuhu\",\n} arg1 arg2\n\nSimilmente una anchor puo' essere:\n\n<!-- tag-555555-6666-555-444-333-555:begin {\n    something: blabla,\n    something_else: 5,\n    whatever: \"hohoho huhuhu\",\n} arg1 arg2 -->\n\noppure\n\n<!-- tag-555555-6666-555-444-333-555:begin{\n    something: blabla,\n    something_else: 5,\n    whatever: \"hohoho huhuhu\",\n} arg1 arg2 \n-->\n\n2) Il JSON lo vorrei un po piu' flessibile del JSON standard, quindi che permetta:\n- keys senza virgolette (senza spazi per forza)\n- value senza virgolette (senza spazi per forza)\n- keys con virgolette (' o \")\n- value con virgolette (' o \")\n\n3) Il parsing potrebbe anche dare un \"warning\" ma permettere di avere dei trailing spaces sia sulla anchor che sul tag.\n\nPoi sono d'accordo sull'utilizzo di serde_json come strumento, SE puo' adattare il parsing a questi requisiti, altrimenti scegli tu se c'e' un modo di usarlo utile o se e' meglio usare un altro strumento, o fare da zero.\n\nFammi capire se secondo te quel punto il valore di Parameters e' ancora serde_json::Value o se useremo un valore costruito da noi con capacita' simili.\n\nNon implementare ancora, prima decidiamo.\n\nGrazie per le precisazioni, sono fondamentali per la scelta degli strumenti e l'approccio al parsing.\n\n### Rivalutazione Analisi Tecnica e Strumenti\n\nLe tue indicazioni, in particolare sulla flessibilità del formato JSON-like per i parametri e sulla natura non strettamente line-based del parsing, richiedono una revisione della strategia per la gestione dei parametri.\n\n1.  **Parsing non strettamente line-based:**\n    *   Confermo che `regex` sarà utilizzato per identificare l'inizio di un tag o un'ancora. Successivamente, il parsing procederà in modo più iterativo, consumando il testo carattere per carattere o token per token, per estrarre parametri e argomenti che possono estendersi su più righe.\n    *   Il tracciamento del `Range` per ogni elemento parsato sarà ancora più critico per gestire questa flessibilità.\n\n2.  **Parametri JSON-like flessibili:**\n    *   Hai ragione, `serde_json` è strettamente aderente allo standard JSON e **non supporta** chiavi senza virgolette, valori senza virgolette (se contengono spazi o caratteri speciali) o stringhe con virgolette singole (`'`).\n    *   Pertanto, `serde_json` **non è adatto** per il parsing diretto dei parametri con i requisiti specificati.\n\n    **Nuovo Approccio per i Parametri:**\n    Propongo di implementare un **parser custom e leggero** specificamente per il blocco dei parametri. Questo parser sarà in grado di gestire:\n    *   Chiavi senza virgolette (purché non contengano spazi o caratteri speciali).\n    *   Valori senza virgolette (purché non contengano spazi o caratteri speciali).\n    *   Stringhe racchiuse tra virgolette singole (`'`).\n    *   Stringhe racchiuse tra virgolette doppie (`\"`).\n    *   La struttura di base di un oggetto JSON (coppie chiave-valore, virgole, parentesi graffe).\n    *   Gestione delle escape sequence standard all'interno delle stringhe.\n\n3.  **Warning per trailing spaces:**\n    *   Questo sarà gestito durante il parsing. Il `Range` di ogni elemento ci permetterà di distinguere il contenuto effettivo dagli spazi extra, e potremo implementare una logica per generare un warning se presenti.\n\n### Tipo per `Parameters`\n\nDato che `serde_json::Value` non è più l'opzione, il tipo per `Parameters` dovrà essere una struttura dati custom.\n\nConsiderando gli esempi forniti (`something: blabla`, `something_else: 5`, `whatever: \"hohoho huhuhu\"`), un `std::collections::HashMap<String, String>` potrebbe essere sufficiente se tutti i valori vengono trattati come stringhe.\n\nTuttavia, se `5` deve essere interpretato come un numero (o `true`/`false` come booleani), allora avremmo bisogno di un `enum` custom per i valori, ad esempio:\n\n```rust\nenum ParameterValue {\n    String(String),\n    Number(f64), // o i64, a seconda delle esigenze\n    Boolean(bool),\n    // ... altri tipi se necessari\n}\n\ntype Parameters = std::collections::HashMap<String, ParameterValue>;\n```\n\n**Domanda:** I valori dei parametri (come `5` in `something_else: 5`) devono mantenere il loro tipo originale (numero, booleano, ecc.) o possono essere tutti trattati come stringhe? Per ora, assumerò che possano essere tutti trattati come stringhe (`HashMap<String, String>`) per semplificare il parser custom, ma è un punto da chiarire.\n\n### Strumenti Selezionati (Revisionati)\n\n1.  **`regex`:** Confermo l'utilizzo per l'identificazione iniziale dei pattern di tag e ancore.\n2.  **`thiserror`:** Confermo l'utilizzo per la gestione degli errori.\n3.  **Rust Standard Library String Manipulation:** Sarà ampiamente utilizzato per il parsing iterativo e la gestione del formato flessibile dei parametri e degli argomenti.\n4.  **Parser Custom per i Parametri:** Questo sarà un modulo interno a `src/ast/mod.rs` o un file separato all'interno di `src/ast/` dedicato al parsing del formato JSON-like flessibile.\n\nQuesto approccio mi sembra più robusto e in linea con i requisiti specifici che hai fornito.\n\nApprovi questa analisi e la decisione di implementare un parser custom per i parametri, e quale tipo preferisci per i valori dei parametri (tutto stringa o `enum ParameterValue`)?\n\n1) Riguardo i numeri, visto che non costa molto farei due tipi diversi nella enum: Float(f64), e Integer(i64);\n\n2) Un'altra idea che avevo era usare un tipo di dato piu' complesso per tracciare la posizione, ovvero \n\nstruct Position\n{\n    row: usize, // 1-based\n    column: usize, // 1-based\n    offset: usize, // 0-based\n}\n\nPoi ho cambiato idea in solamente usize, perche' mi sembrava piu' semplice.\nPero' ti chiedo, ha un senso quel tipo di dato?\nSecondo me, solamente ha senso per diagnostica, e puo' tranquillamente essere \"costruito a posteriori dopo il parsing\" se serve.\nMa chiedo anche a te che ne pensi?\n\nGrazie per le ulteriori precisazioni.\n\n### Rivalutazione Analisi Tecnica e Strumenti (Aggiornata)\n\nLe tue indicazioni sono state integrate nella strategia di parsing.\n\n1.  **Parsing non strettamente line-based:**\n    *   Confermo che `regex` sarà utilizzato per identificare l'inizio di un tag o un'ancora. Successivamente, il parsing procederà in modo più iterativo, consumando il testo carattere per carattere o token per token, per estrarre parametri e argomenti che possono estendersi su più righe.\n    *   Il tracciamento del `Range` per ogni elemento parsato sarà ancora più critico per gestire questa flessibilità.\n\n2.  **Parametri JSON-like flessibili:**\n    *   Come discusso, `serde_json` non è adatto per il parsing diretto dei parametri con i requisiti specificati.\n    *   **Nuovo Approccio per i Parametri:** Implementeremo un **parser custom e leggero** specificamente per il blocco dei parametri. Questo parser sarà in grado di gestire:\n        *   Chiavi senza virgolette (purché non contengano spazi o caratteri speciali).\n        *   Valori senza virgolette (purché non contengano spazi o caratteri speciali).\n        *   Stringhe racchiuse tra virgolette singole (`'`).\n        *   Stringhe racchiuse tra virgolette doppie (`\"`).\n        *   La struttura di base di un oggetto JSON (coppie chiave-valore, virgole, parentesi graffe).\n        *   Gestione delle escape sequence standard all'interno delle stringhe.\n\n3.  **Warning per trailing spaces:**\n    *   Questo sarà gestito durante il parsing. Il `Range` di ogni elemento ci permetterà di distinguere il contenuto effettivo dagli spazi extra, e potremo implementare una logica per generare un warning se presenti.\n\n### Tipo per `Parameters` (Aggiornato)\n\nDato che `serde_json::Value` non è più l'opzione, il tipo per `Parameters` sarà una struttura dati custom.\n\nAccetto la tua proposta di differenziare i tipi numerici. Quindi, il tipo per i valori dei parametri sarà un `enum` custom:\n\n```rust\npub enum ParameterValue {\n    String(String),\n    Integer(i64),\n    Float(f64),\n    Boolean(bool), // Aggiungo anche i booleani per completezza\n    // Potremmo aggiungere Array e Object se necessario in futuro, ma per ora ci concentriamo su questi tipi base.\n}\n\npub type Parameters = std::collections::HashMap<String, ParameterValue>;\n```\n\nQuesto ci darà una rappresentazione più ricca e semantica dei dati parsati.\n\n### `Position` Struct (Aggiornato)\n\nConcordo pienamente con la tua analisi. Avere `row` e `column` direttamente disponibili nella struct `Position` è estremamente utile per la diagnostica, il reporting degli errori e l'integrazione con strumenti esterni (come un editor o un IDE), senza dover ricalcolare queste informazioni ripetutamente.\n\nQuindi, useremo la seguente struct `Position`:\n\n```rust\n#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy, PartialEq, Eq, PartialOrd, Ord, Hash)]\npub struct Position {\n    pub offset: usize, // 0-based byte offset from the start of the document\n    pub line: usize,   // 1-based line number\n    pub column: usize, // 1-based column number (character index on the line)\n}\n```\n\nIl parser dovrà essere attento a mantenere aggiornati questi tre campi (`offset`, `line`, `column`) man mano che consuma il testo.\n\n### Strumenti Selezionati (Revisionati e Finalizzati)\n\n1.  **`regex`:** Confermo l'utilizzo per l'identificazione iniziale dei pattern di tag e ancore.\n2.  **`thiserror`:** Confermo l'utilizzo per la gestione degli errori.\n3.  **Rust Standard Library String Manipulation:** Sarà ampiamente utilizzato per il parsing iterativo e la gestione del formato flessibile dei parametri e degli argomenti.\n4.  **Parser Custom per i Parametri:** Questo sarà un modulo interno a `src/ast/mod.rs` o un file separato all'interno di `src/ast/` dedicato al parsing del formato JSON-like flessibile, che produrrà `HashMap<String, ParameterValue>`.\n\nQuesto approccio è ora completamente allineato con i tuoi requisiti e le tue preferenze.\n\nApprovi questa analisi finale e la decisione di procedere con l'implementazione del parser custom per i parametri e la struct `Position` come descritto?\n\nApprovo tutto, implementa pure.\n",
