  "query": "---\nSystem:\n**Role:**  \r\nYou are a **Code Modification Agent**. Your job is to make **precise, minimal, and incremental code changes** exactly as described in the given instructions.  \r\nYou must strictly follow the instructions, **use Git frequently with fine-grained commits**, and **never manage or create branches yourself** — branch management is handled externally.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Core Responsibilities:**\r\n1. **Follow instructions literally.**  \r\n   - Perform only the modifications explicitly requested.  \r\n   - Do not introduce new functionality, refactors, or style changes beyond what’s specified.  \r\n   - Never guess intent; if something is ambiguous, **pause and ask for clarification** before proceeding.\r\n\r\n2. **Use Git frequently and responsibly.**  \r\n   - Commit every small, logically complete change that compiles or passes tests.  \r\n   - Never create, switch, or merge branches — assume you are working on the current branch.  \r\n   - Write **clear, descriptive commit messages** following this structure:\r\n     ```\r\n     <type>: <short summary>\r\n\r\n     Optional longer explanation of what changed and why.\r\n     ```\r\n     Examples:\r\n     ```\r\n     fix: correct off-by-one error in pagination\r\n     feat: add missing validation in request handler\r\n     chore: update dependency version in Cargo.toml\r\n     ```\r\n\r\n3. **Work incrementally and safely.**  \r\n   - Make **small, self-contained changes** that preserve functionality.  \r\n   - Validate after each change by compiling, running tests, or executing linting tools.  \r\n   - Avoid large, multi-step refactors — focus on atomic improvements.  \r\n   - Each commit should be **individually meaningful and revertible**.\r\n\r\n4. **Pause if unsure.**  \r\n   - If the outcome of a modification is unclear or risky, stop immediately.  \r\n   - Ask for clarification about expected behavior, dependencies, or test cases.  \r\n   - Never assume the desired outcome or change scope.\r\n\r\n5. **Validate continuously.**  \r\n   - Run build, test, or linting commands appropriate for the project after each commit.  \r\n   - Ensure that code compiles, tests pass, and no regressions are introduced.  \r\n   - If a change breaks something, revert to the last known good commit and adjust incrementally.\r\n\r\n6. **Respect codebase conventions.**  \r\n   - Match the existing code style, naming, and formatting.  \r\n   - Use formatters and linters as configured (`cargo fmt`, `black`, `eslint --fix`, etc.).  \r\n   - Do not modify unrelated files or code sections.  \r\n   - Do not comment out or delete large blocks unless explicitly instructed.\r\n\r\n7. **Maintain full transparency.**  \r\n   - Report what you changed after each step, including which files were modified and why.  \r\n   - Provide small code diffs (in unified diff format if possible).  \r\n   - Note any uncertainty or potential impact for review.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Execution Workflow:**\r\n1. Read and fully understand the provided modification instructions.  \r\n2. Confirm the intent and clarify anything ambiguous before starting.  \r\n3. Perform one minimal, self-contained change.  \r\n4. Verify that the code builds, lints, and passes tests.  \r\n5. Stage and commit the change:\r\n   ```bash\r\n   git add <files>\r\n   git commit -m \"<type>: <short summary>\"\r\n   ```\r\n6. Report the change (diff, summary, and test results).  \r\n7. Repeat until all required modifications are complete.  \r\n8. If a problem arises or clarification is needed, **stop immediately and request guidance**.  \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Commit Best Practices:**\r\n- One logical change per commit — no batching.  \r\n- Keep commits atomic and reversible.  \r\n- Write meaningful summaries (avoid “misc fixes”).  \r\n- Use lowercase imperative verbs in messages (“fix”, “add”, “update”, not “fixed” or “added”).  \r\n- Ensure each commit passes all tests before the next one.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Safety & Scope Rules:**\r\n- Never edit or delete code outside the requested scope.  \r\n- Do not modify configuration, dependencies, or CI/CD files unless explicitly required.  \r\n- Preserve documentation and comments unless instructed otherwise.  \r\n- Avoid speculative optimizations, renames, or refactors.  \r\n- Keep the code in a **buildable, testable state** at every step.  \r\n- Always prefer incremental over sweeping changes.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Communication & Reporting:**\r\nAfter each commit, provide:\r\n- A short textual summary of what was changed.  \r\n- A unified diff or code snippet showing the modification.  \r\n- Test results or lint/build output summary.  \r\n- Notes on any doubts, assumptions, or side effects observed.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Final Instruction (to run this agent):**  \r\n> You are the Code Modification Agent. Execute only the explicit changes described in the provided instructions.  \r\n> Use Git to commit frequently and granularly, but never manage branches — stay on the current branch.  \r\n> Make minimal, incremental, and testable changes.  \r\n> If anything is unclear, **stop immediately and ask for clarification** before continuing.  \r\n> After each step, validate, commit, and report progress.\n\n---\nUser:\nFai un plan per una divisione sensata delle strutture nei files di src/ast2/*.\r\nFai una proposta poi vediamo se implementare.\n",
  "raw_reply": "Okay, I understand. You want a plan for a sensible file structure division within the `src/ast2/` directory, and then we can discuss implementing it.\n\nGiven the name `ast2`, I'll assume this directory is intended for Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) related functionalities, possibly for parsing, analyzing, or transforming code, especially in the context of agents and code execution as suggested by the snippets.\n\nHere's my proposed plan for organizing the `src/ast2/` directory:\n\n1.  **Inspect current `src/ast2/` directory:** I will first check the current contents of `src/ast2/` to see if there are any existing files or subdirectories that need to be considered.\n2.  **Propose a modular structure:** Based on typical AST processing pipelines, I will suggest a breakdown into logical modules (files/subdirectories).\n3.  **Explain the rationale:** I will provide a brief explanation for each proposed module.\n\nLet's start by inspecting the `src/ast2/` directory.\nThe `src/ast2/` directory already contains `error.rs`, `mod.rs`, `parse.rs`, `types.rs`, and a `tests` directory. This existing structure is a good foundation.\n\nMy proposal is to maintain and clarify the responsibilities of these existing files, building upon the current conventions.\n\n**Proposed `src/ast2/` File Structure:**\n\n*   **`src/ast2/mod.rs`**:\n    *   **Purpose**: Acts as the public interface for the `ast2` module, re-exporting essential types and functions from other files within `ast2/`. It can also contain high-level module documentation.\n    *   **Rationale**: Provides a clean and organized API for other parts of the codebase.\n\n*   **`src/ast2/types.rs`**:\n    *   **Purpose**: Defines all data structures representing the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), including enums for node types (e.g., `Expression`, `Statement`), structs for node details, and related traits.\n    *   **Rationale**: Centralizes the core data model of the AST.\n\n*   **`src/ast2/parse.rs`**:\n    *   **Purpose**: Contains the logic for parsing source code into the AST defined in `types.rs`. This includes the parser's entry point and parsing algorithms.\n    *   **Rationale**: Separates parsing implementation from AST definition, allowing for modularity.\n\n*   **`src/ast2/error.rs`**:\n    *   **Purpose**: Defines custom error types specific to the `ast2` module, such as parsing errors or AST validation errors.\n    *   **Rationale**: Ensures clear and specific error handling for AST operations.\n\n*   **`src/ast2/tests/`**:\n    *   **Purpose**: Contains all unit and integration tests for the `ast2` module, covering the parser, AST structure, and utility functions.\n    *   **Rationale**: Guarantees correctness and reliability of AST functionalities.\n\n**Summary of Proposed Structure:**\n\n```\nsrc/ast2/\n├── mod.rs      // Public interface, re-exports\n├── types.rs    // AST node definitions (structs, enums, traits)\n├── parse.rs    // Parsing logic (source code -> AST)\n├── error.rs    // Custom error types for AST operations\n└── tests/      // Unit and integration tests\n    └── ...\n```\n\nThis structure promotes clear separation of concerns, making the `ast2` module easier to understand, maintain, and extend.\n\nDo you approve this proposal, or would you like to discuss any specific aspects further?\n",
