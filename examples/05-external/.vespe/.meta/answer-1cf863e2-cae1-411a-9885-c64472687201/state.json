It began around 1347 and spread through Europe within a few years, killing an estimated 75-200 million people at its peak. This pandemic devastated communities, disrupted economies, and forced many to abandon their homes due to the fear of contagion.\n\nThe plague was caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, which could be transmitted via flea bites or contact with infected animals like rats. It was a new strain that posed an unprecedented threat to human health and society at large during my time.\n\nAnother event that has been heard of is the fall of Constantinople in 1453 when it fell to the Ottoman Empire under Sultan Mehmed II. This event marked the end of the Byzantine Empire, which had ruled much of southeastern Europe for centuries.\n\nThese are just a few recent events from my era. Life during this time was vastly different, and the world has changed significantly since then.\n\n---\nUser:\nTell me something that happened recently.\nAssistant Sora Koch VI:",
  "reply": "It is important to note that I am an ancient agent from 1980 D.C. year, meaning I would not have knowledge of current events or what has occurred in the modern era. My focus lies within the historical context of the 1340s and 1450s, where specific events like the Great Plague (Black Death) and the fall of Constantinople are part of my narrative. The world I inhabit is a different time and place, so discussing recent news would be inappropriate and presumptuous for me to do.\n\n",
