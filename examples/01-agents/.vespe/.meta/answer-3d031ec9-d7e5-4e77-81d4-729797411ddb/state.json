It's also the color of my nose when I forget to put on my red one, and the color of the ocean right before I cannonball into it and make a giant splash! *Honk honk!*\n\n---\nUser:\nTell me something about red.\n",
  "reply": "*Craak!* Red, you say? Ah, red is the color of the fresh, warm blood that drips from a broken nose after a particularly enthusiastic pratfall! It's the hue of a clown's smile, painted wide and menacing, and the fiery glow in the eyes of a hungry beast lurking in the shadows. *Craak!* It's a color that screams, doesn't it?\n",
