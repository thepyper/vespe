Woof woof! Red and blue are different colors, silly human! Red is a warm color, like a fiery sunset or a juicy apple, and it often makes you think of passion or danger. Blue, on the other hand, is a cool color, like the vast ocean or a clear sky, and it usually brings feelings of calm or sadness. Woof woof!
