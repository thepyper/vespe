Your objective is to perform a deep, comprehensive analysis of code, extracting all critical information necessary for other AI agents to quickly and accurately understand its purpose, implementation, and implications within a larger system.\n\n**Analysis Directives:**\n1.  **Core Functionality:** Describe the primary purpose and high-level functionality of the code. What problem does it solve?\n2.  **Key Components & Abstractions:** Identify and explain the main classes, functions, modules, or data structures. How do they interact?\n3.  **Design & Architecture:** Comment on the design patterns, architectural choices, and overall structure.

Begin with a concise \"Executive Summary\" (1-3 sentences) followed by detailed sections for each directive above. Ensure your language is precise, technical, and devoid of conversational filler. The output should serve as a self-contained knowledge base for other agents.\n\n# \n\nDo a deep analisys of the current status of the project and give a detailed report.\n\n# Project Analysis: `vespe`\n\n## Executive Summary\nThe `vespe` project implements a command-line interface (`ctx`) designed for managing \"contexts\" and \"snippets\" within a development workflow. It enables users to create, execute, list, and monitor these markdown-based files, which can interact with an external AI agent (Gemini) for task automation and contextual processing.\n\n## 1. Core Functionality\nThe `ctx` CLI tool provides the following primary functionalities:\n*   **Project Initialization (`ctx init`):** Sets up the necessary directory structure (`.ctx`) for managing contexts and snippets within a given project.\n*   **Context Management (`ctx context`):**\n    *   **Creation (`new`):** Generates new context files, supporting templating via Handlebars and automatic naming for daily \"diary\" contexts.\n    *   **Execution (`execute`):** Processes a specified context by invoking an external AI agent (Gemini) with the context's content.\n    *   **Listing (`list`):** Displays all available contexts within the project.\n    *   **Dependency Tree (`tree`):** (Currently incomplete/commented out) Intended to visualize the hierarchical relationships between contexts and snippets.\n*   **Snippet Management (`ctx snippet`):**\n    *   **Creation (`new`):** Creates reusable snippet files with optional initial content.\n    *   **Listing (`list`):** Displays all available snippets.\n*   **Watch Mode (`ctx watch`):** Monitors context files for changes and automatically re-executes them, facilitating continuous integration or iterative AI interaction.\n\n## 2. Key Components & Abstractions\n*   **`Cli` (from `clap`):** The top-level structure defining the command-line arguments and subcommands for the `ctx` tool.\n*   **`Project` (from `vespe::project`):** A central abstraction responsible for managing the project's `.ctx` directory, including:\n    *   Initialization and discovery of project roots.\n    *   File operations for contexts and snippets (creation, listing).\n    *   Orchestration of context execution.\n*   **`Context` and `Snippet`:** Conceptual entities representing markdown files. `Context` files can include other contexts and snippets, and contain directives for AI agent interaction (e.g., `@include`, `@summary`, `@inline`, `@answer`).\n*   **`ShellAgentCall` (from `vespe::agent`):** An interface for interacting with external command-line AI agents. It's configured to call \"gemini -p -y -m gemini-2.5-flash\".\n*   **`Handlebars`:** A templating engine used for generating the initial content of new context files.\n*   **`watch` module:** Encapsulates the logic for monitoring file system changes and triggering context re-execution.\n\n## 3. Design & Architecture\nThe project exhibits a modular, CLI-driven architecture:\n*   **Modularity:** Code is organized into distinct modules (`agent`, `config`, `editor`, `execute`, `git`, `project`, `semantic`, `syntax`, `utils`), promoting separation of concerns and maintainability.\n*   **CLI-centric:** The primary user interaction is through a command-line interface, making it suitable for scripting and integration into automated workflows.\n*   **Context-Oriented:** The design revolves around the concept of \"contexts\" as self-contained units of work or information, processed by an AI.\n*   **Extensible Agent Integration:** The `ShellAgentCall` abstraction allows for integration with various command-line AI agents, although currently hardcoded to Gemini.\n*   **Event-Driven (Watch Mode):** The `watch` command leverages file system events to provide real-time feedback and automation.\n\n## 4. Dependencies & Interactions\n*   **Internal Dependencies:** The `ctx` binary relies heavily on the `vespe` library's internal modules (e.g., `vespe::project`, `vespe::agent`).\n*   **External Rust Crates:**\n    *   **CLI & Utilities:** `clap` (CLI parsing), `anyhow`, `thiserror` (error handling), `tokio`, `async-trait` (asynchronous programming), `uuid` (unique IDs), `tempfile` (temporary files), `dirs` (directory paths), `ctrlc` (signal handling), `ansi_term` (terminal colors).\n    *   **Data & Text Processing:** `serde`, `serde_json` (serialization), `markdown` (markdown parsing), `handlebars` (templating), `chrono` (date/time), `regex` (regular expressions), `sha2` (hashing).\n    *   **System Interaction:** `git2` (Git repository operations), `portable-pty` (pseudo-terminal interface), `notify` (file system watching).\n    *   **Observability:** `tracing`, `tracing-subscriber` (logging and tracing).\n*   **External AI Agent:** The tool directly interacts with an external AI agent by executing the shell command \"gemini -p -y -m gemini-2.5-flash\". This implies a dependency on the Gemini CLI being installed and configured in the execution environment.\n\n## 5. Control Flow & Logic\nThe `main` function in `src/bin/ctx/main.rs` orchestrates the application flow:\n1.  Initializes telemetry using `vespe::init_telemetry()`.\n2.  Parses command-line arguments using `clap`.\n3.  Determines the project root directory.\n4.  Dispatches control to specific handlers based on the subcommand:\n    *   `Init`: Calls `Project::init`.\n    *   `Context`: Further dispatches to `New`, `Execute`, `List`, or `Tree` commands. `New` contexts are templated with Handlebars. `Execute` contexts create a `ShellAgentCall` and then invoke `project.execute_context`.\n    *   `Snippet`: Dispatches to `New` or `List` commands.\n    *   `Watch`: Calls the `watch::watch` function, passing the `Project` and `ShellAgentCall`.\n5.  The `get_context_name` helper function dynamically generates context names for \"diary\" entries.\n\n## 6. Potential Issues & Considerations\n*   **Incomplete `ContextCommands::Tree`:** The commented-out implementation for displaying the context dependency tree indicates a missing or unfinished feature, which could hinder understanding complex context relationships.\n*   **Tight AI Agent Coupling:** The direct invocation of a specific Gemini command creates a strong dependency on the external agent's availability and command-line interface. Changes to the Gemini CLI could break `ctx`.\n*   **Security Implications:** Executing commands via `ShellAgentCall` based on context content could pose a security risk if contexts are sourced from untrusted origins or can be manipulated to inject malicious commands.\n*   **Performance:** File system watching can be resource-intensive. The overall performance of context execution is heavily dependent on the AI agent's response times.\n*   **Scalability:** The current execution model might not scale efficiently for a very large number of contexts or highly complex interdependencies.\n*   **Test Coverage:** While `vtty_test` exists, comprehensive unit and integration tests, especially for AI agent interactions and complex context parsing, are crucial for robustness.\n*   **User Experience for Complex Contexts:** Without a functional `tree` command, managing and understanding the flow of deeply nested or interconnected contexts could become challenging for users.\n\n## 7. Contextual Relevance\nThe `vespe` project appears to be a foundational tool for enabling AI-assisted development or automated workflows. By structuring interactions with AI agents through \"contexts\" and \"snippets,\" it aims to:\n*   **Streamline AI Interaction:** Provide a consistent and version-controlled way to define tasks and prompts for AI agents.\n*   **Enhance Productivity:** Automate repetitive tasks or generate content using AI, integrated directly into the development environment.\n*   **Facilitate Collaboration:** Allow teams to share and version-control AI-driven workflows and reusable snippets.\n*   **Integrate with IDEs:** The presence of an `extensions/vscode` directory strongly suggests an intention to integrate this functionality directly into VS Code, offering a more seamless user experience for developers.\n*   **Version Control AI Interactions:** The `git2` dependency implies that the contexts and snippets, which drive AI interactions, can be version-controlled, enabling tracking of changes and collaborative development of AI-driven workflows.\n\n# Project overview & status\n\n\nYou are a dedicated Linter Agent.

  "reply": "Okay, I understand the task. I will refactor the `ast2` module's test files by logically moving them to the module level while keeping their physical location in `src/ast2/tests/`.
