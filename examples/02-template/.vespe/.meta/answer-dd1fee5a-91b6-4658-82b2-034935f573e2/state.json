Many \"blue\" flowers or animals actually use clever tricks of light and structure to appear blue, rather than containing blue pigments.\n2.  **Expensive Pigment:** Historically, ultramarine blue, derived from the lapis lazuli stone, was one of the most expensive pigments, often reserved for depicting royalty or divine figures.\n3.  **Calming Effect:** Blue is frequently associated with feelings of calm, tranquility, and peace. It's often used in bedrooms and healthcare facilities for this reason.\n4.  **Blue Foods:** Blue is not a common color for natural foods, and blue food coloring can sometimes suppress appetite because our brains don't associate blue with edible items.\n5.  **\"Blue\" in Language:** Many languages historically didn't have a distinct word for blue, often grouping it with green or other dark colors. The perception and naming of blue evolved later in human language and culture.\n\n---\nUser:\nTell me 5 trivia about color orange.\n",
