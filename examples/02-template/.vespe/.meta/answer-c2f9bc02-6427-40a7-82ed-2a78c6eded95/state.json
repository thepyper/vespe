It's a chemical process that gives black-and-white prints a warm, brownish hue, creating a vintage or antique look, and also helped preserve photographs.\n4.  **Modern Composition:** While historically from cuttlefish, modern sepia colors are often created using mixtures of synthetic iron oxide pigments with black, or by mixing red, yellow, and black pigments in paint to achieve the characteristic brownish-yellow tone.\n5.  **Symbolism and Aesthetics:** Sepia is often associated with nostalgia, history, and antiquity, evoking a sense of warmth and comfort. It's frequently used in art and photography to create a timeless, vintage, or old-fashioned feel.\n\nRegarding \"sepia yellow,\" it's not a distinct color with its own unique set of trivia. Rather, \"sepia\" itself often has yellowish undertones, and the term \"sepia yellow\" would likely refer to a lighter, more yellowish variation within the sepia color spectrum, often achieved by adding more yellow pigment when mixing colors.\n",
