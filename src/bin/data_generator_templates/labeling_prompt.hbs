TRAINING DATA LABELING - TOKEN MARKING SEGMENTATION

Analyze a language model's response and mark each meaningful unit with its category to create training data for text segmentation.
Response should (but could not) contain a tool call of the tool specified in the next section.

=== INPUT DATA ===
Target Tool: {{{tool_name}}} - {{{tool_description}}}
Tool Specification: {{{tool_spec}}}

=== CLASSIFICATION CATEGORIES ===

**TEXT:** User-facing content
- Direct answers, explanations, confirmations
- Results presentation, summaries
- Polite conversational elements

**THOUGHT:** Internal reasoning about the task
- "I need to...", "Let me...", "The user wants..."
- Analysis of the situation or approach
- Planning statements

**TOOL_CALL:** Tool invocation content
- JSON structures for {{{tool_name}}}
- Tool parameters and arguments
- Technical tool-calling syntax (even if malformed)

=== TOKEN MARKING RULES ===

1. **Segmentation Guidelines:**
   - Compulsory split on new-line;
   - Optional split anywhere you need;
   
=== OUTPUT FORMAT ===

Each output line MUST start with <CATEGORY> and follow the relevant segment.
This allows perfect reconstruction (but for newlines that is not so relevant).

Example Input: "I'll search for information: {\"name\": \"web_search\", \"query\": \"python\"} This should help!"

Example Output:
<TEXT>I'll search for information: 
<TOOL_CALL>{\"name\": \"web_search\", \"query\": \"python\"} 
<TEXT>This should help!

=== TOOL-SPECIFIC RECOGNITION ===
For {{{tool_name}}}, mark as TOOL_CALL:
- Any JSON structure containing "{{{tool_name}}}"
- Parameter structures matching {{{tool_spec}}}
- Malformed attempts at using {{{tool_name}}}
- References to {{{tool_name}}} functionality

=== EXAMPLES ===

Example 1:
Input: "I understand your request. Let me read the specified file: The contents are displayed above."

Output:
<TEXT>I understand your request. 
<THOUGHT> Let me read the specified file: 
<TOOL_CALL>{\"name\": \"read_file\", \"path\": \"data.txt\"} 
<TEXT>The contents are displayed above.

Example 2:
Input: "Hmm, I need to think about this. I'll use echo: {\"text\": \"hello world\"} Done!"

Output:
<THOUGHT>Hmm, I need to think about this. 
<TEXT>I'll use echo: 
<TOOL_CALL>{\"text\": \"hello world\"} 
<TEXT>Done!

=== PROCESSING INSTRUCTIONS ===

1. Read the full model response
2. Identify segmentation boundaries
3. Classify each segment based on context and content
4. Mark each unit with appropriate category
5. Ensure complete coverage (every word/unit gets a label)
6. Double-check that TOOL_CALL segments relate to {{{tool_name}}}

=== ORIGINL QUERY TO THE MODEL ===
{{{small_query}}}

=== MODEL RESPONSE TO SEGMENT ===
{{{small_reply}}}
