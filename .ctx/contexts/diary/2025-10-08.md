Modifica la funzione project.rs Project::create_context_file per accettare un secondo argomento, Option<String> con un contenuto iniziale.
Se c'e', scrivi direttamente questo contenuto iniziale nel nuovo file creato.

Fai la stessa cosa per create_snippet_file.

Okay, I understand. I will always use git for fine-grained commits with descriptive messages, write production-ready code following best practices, and read files before modifying them. I will also ensure my responses are formatted with markdown.

Now, let's modify the `project.rs` file.

First, I need to locate the `project.rs` file.Okay, `H:\my\github\vespe\src\project.rs` it is. I'll read its content to understand `create_context_file` and `create_snippet_file`.I'll modify `create_context_file` and `create_snippet_file` in `project.rs`. Both will accept an `Option<String>` for `initial_content`. If provided, that content will be written; otherwise, an empty string. I'll start with `create_context_file`.Okay, `create_snippet_file` next. Same as before.Modified `create_context_file` and `create_snippet_file` in `src/project.rs` to accept `Option<String>` for initial content. Committing changes now.`git status` confirms `src/project.rs` was modified. Ignoring unrelated deleted/untracked files, I'll commit the changes with a descriptive message.`src/project.rs` is staged. Committing.Right, `run_shell_command` and multi-line commits don't mix. I'll use a single-line message, then explain the constraint to the user.I've committed changes to `src/project.rs`, adding `Option<String>` for initial content in `create_context_file` and `create_snippet_file`. Due to `run_shell_command` limitations, the commit message is single-line. For a detailed message, use `git commit --amend`. What's next?
