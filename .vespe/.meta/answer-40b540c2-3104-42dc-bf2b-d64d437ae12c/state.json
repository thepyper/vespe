  "query": "---\nUser:\nLeggi README.md, voglio che integri la sezione Answer Advanced, la parte Advanced Prompt Control: alla fine aggiungi una sezione per\r\ndocumentare le opzioni with_agent_names, e with_invitation.\r\nPer capire bene cosa fanno leggi src/execute2/content.rs, in brebe:\r\n- with_agent_names inventa dei nomi fittizzi per diversi agent; serve per prompt in cui c'e' una cronologia della conversazione fatta da diversi agent,\r\n  per mantenere la coerenza personale; anche nel system prompt viene aggiungo un \"You are <agent_name>\".\r\n- with_invitation appende a fine prompt un \"Assistant:\" (o \"Assistant <agent_name>:\") come ulteriore indizio del turno del llm.\n",
  "reply": "Okay, I will first read the `src/execute2/content.rs` file to understand the `with_agent_names` and `with_invitation` options. Then, I will read the `README.md` file to identify the correct location and finally, I will add the new section with the documentation.\nI've reviewed `src/execute2/content.rs` and now understand `with_agent_names` and `with_invitation`. The former assigns a persistent name and \"You are <agent_name>\" system message, using \"Assistant <agent_name>:\" for agent messages. The latter appends \"Assistant:\" or \"Assistant <agent_name>:\" to the prompt. I'll now locate the \"Answer Advanced\" -> \"Advanced Prompt Control\" section in `README.md` to add this documentation.\nI've located the `**Advanced Prompt Control:**` subsection within `### @answer Advanced` in `README.md`. I'll add documentation for `with_agent_names` and `with_invitation` there. My plan is to create the new content and then use the `replace` tool to insert it. The new content will explain how `with_agent_names` provides consistent agent personas and `with_invitation` cues the LLM for a response. I'll place this right after the \"Advanced Prompt Control\" heading and before \"Input Redirection,\" then prepare the `replace` call with the necessary context.\nREADME.md updated with `with_agent_names` and `with_invitation` documentation as you requested. Shall I commit the changes, or would you like to review them first?\nOkay, I'll commit the changes. I'll stage `README.md`, then commit with a detailed message explaining the new `with_agent_names` and `with_invitation` options for the `@answer` tag, as per your instructions. Staging the file now.\nStaged. Committing now.\nCommit successful. Checking git status.\nOkay, the commit is done and the working tree is clean. I've updated the `README.md` as requested. I'm ready for what's next.Okay, the working tree is clean and the commit is done. I'm informing the user the task is complete.\nI've updated the `README.md` and committed the changes as requested. The task is now complete.Request complete: `README.md` updated and committed. Awaiting next instruction.Okay, `README.md` changes are committed.
