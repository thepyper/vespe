It enables users to create, execute, list, and monitor these markdown-based files, which can interact with an external AI agent (Gemini) for task automation and contextual processing.\n\n## 1. Core Functionality\nThe `ctx` CLI tool provides the following primary functionalities:\n*   **Project Initialization (`ctx init`):** Sets up the necessary directory structure (`.ctx`) for managing contexts and snippets within a given project.\n*   **Context Management (`ctx context`):**\n    *   **Creation (`new`):** Generates new context files, supporting templating via Handlebars and automatic naming for daily \"diary\" contexts.\n    *   **Execution (`execute`):** Processes a specified context by invoking an external AI agent (Gemini) with the context's content.\n    *   **Listing (`list`):** Displays all available contexts within the project.\n    *   **Dependency Tree (`tree`):** (Currently incomplete/commented out) Intended to visualize the hierarchical relationships between contexts and snippets.\n*   **Snippet Management (`ctx snippet`):**\n    *   **Creation (`new`):** Creates reusable snippet files with optional initial content.\n    *   **Listing (`list`):** Displays all available snippets.\n*   **Watch Mode (`ctx watch`):** Monitors context files for changes and automatically re-executes them, facilitating continuous integration or iterative AI interaction.\n\n## 2. Key Components & Abstractions\n*   **`Cli` (from `clap`):** The top-level structure defining the command-line arguments and subcommands for the `ctx` tool.\n*   **`Project` (from `vespe::project`):** A central abstraction responsible for managing the project's `.ctx` directory, including:\n    *   Initialization and discovery of project roots.\n    *   File operations for contexts and snippets (creation, listing).\n    *   Orchestration of context execution.\n*   **`Context` and `Snippet`:** Conceptual entities representing markdown files. `Context` files can include other contexts and snippets, and contain directives for AI agent interaction (e.g., `@include`, `@summary`, `@inline`, `@answer`).\n*   **`ShellAgentCall` (from `vespe::agent`):** An interface for interacting with external command-line AI agents. It's configured to call \"gemini -p -y -m gemini-2.5-flash\".\n*   **`Handlebars`:** A templating engine used for generating the initial content of new context files.\n*   **`watch` module:** Encapsulates the logic for monitoring file system changes and triggering context re-execution.\n\n## 3. Design & Architecture\nThe project exhibits a modular, CLI-driven architecture:\n*   **Modularity:** Code is organized into distinct modules (`agent`, `config`, `editor`, `execute`, `git`, `project`, `semantic`, `syntax`, `utils`), promoting separation of concerns and maintainability.\n*   **CLI-centric:** The primary user interaction is through a command-line interface, making it suitable for scripting and integration into automated workflows.\n*   **Context-Oriented:** The design revolves around the concept of \"contexts\" as self-contained units of work or information, processed by an AI.\n*   **Extensible Agent Integration:** The `ShellAgentCall` abstraction allows for integration with various command-line AI agents, although currently hardcoded to Gemini.\n*   **Event-Driven (Watch Mode):** The `watch` command leverages file system events to provide real-time feedback and automation.\n\n## 4. Dependencies & Interactions\n*   **Internal Dependencies:** The `ctx` binary relies heavily on the `vespe` library's internal modules (e.g., `vespe::project`, `vespe::agent`).\n*   **External Rust Crates:**\n    *   **CLI & Utilities:** `clap` (CLI parsing), `anyhow`, `thiserror` (error handling), `tokio`, `async-trait` (asynchronous programming), `uuid` (unique IDs), `tempfile` (temporary files), `dirs` (directory paths), `ctrlc` (signal handling), `ansi_term` (terminal colors).\n    *   **Data & Text Processing:** `serde`, `serde_json` (serialization), `markdown` (markdown parsing), `handlebars` (templating), `chrono` (date/time), `regex` (regular expressions), `sha2` (hashing).\n    *   **System Interaction:** `git2` (Git repository operations), `portable-pty` (pseudo-terminal interface), `notify` (file system watching).\n    *   **Observability:** `tracing`, `tracing-subscriber` (logging and tracing).\n*   **External AI Agent:** The tool directly interacts with an external AI agent by executing the shell command \"gemini -p -y -m gemini-2.5-flash\". This implies a dependency on the Gemini CLI being installed and configured in the execution environment.\n\n## 5. Control Flow & Logic\nThe `main` function in `src/bin/ctx/main.rs` orchestrates the application flow:\n1.  Initializes telemetry using `vespe::init_telemetry()`.\n2.  Parses command-line arguments using `clap`.\n3.  Determines the project root directory.\n4.  Dispatches control to specific handlers based on the subcommand:\n    *   `Init`: Calls `Project::init`.\n    *   `Context`: Further dispatches to `New`, `Execute`, `List`, or `Tree` commands. `New` contexts are templated with Handlebars. `Execute` contexts create a `ShellAgentCall` and then invoke `project.execute_context`.\n    *   `Snippet`: Dispatches to `New` or `List` commands.\n    *   `Watch`: Calls the `watch::watch` function, passing the `Project` and `ShellAgentCall`.\n5.  The `get_context_name` helper function dynamically generates context names for \"diary\" entries.\n\n## 6. Potential Issues & Considerations\n*   **Incomplete `ContextCommands::Tree`:** The commented-out implementation for displaying the context dependency tree indicates a missing or unfinished feature, which could hinder understanding complex context relationships.\n*   **Tight AI Agent Coupling:** The direct invocation of a specific Gemini command creates a strong dependency on the external agent's availability and command-line interface. Changes to the Gemini CLI could break `ctx`.\n*   **Security Implications:** Executing commands via `ShellAgentCall` based on context content could pose a security risk if contexts are sourced from untrusted origins or can be manipulated to inject malicious commands.\n*   **Performance:** File system watching can be resource-intensive. The overall performance of context execution is heavily dependent on the AI agent's response times.\n*   **Scalability:** The current execution model might not scale efficiently for a very large number of contexts or highly complex interdependencies.\n*   **Test Coverage:** While `vtty_test` exists, comprehensive unit and integration tests, especially for AI agent interactions and complex context parsing, are crucial for robustness.\n*   **User Experience for Complex Contexts:** Without a functional `tree` command, managing and understanding the flow of deeply nested or interconnected contexts could become challenging for users.\n\n## 7. Contextual Relevance\nThe `vespe` project appears to be a foundational tool for enabling AI-assisted development or automated workflows.

By leveraging markdown-based \"contexts\" and reusable \"snippets,\" `ctx` allows you to define, execute, and manage AI-driven tasks directly from your terminal. Whether you're generating code, summarizing documents, or automating complex processes, `ctx` provides a structured and version-controlled approach to AI assistance.\n\n## Features\n*   **Context Management:** Create, execute, and list markdown-based contexts that serve as prompts or instructions for your AI agent.\n*   **Snippet Management:** Define and reuse common markdown snippets across multiple contexts, promoting consistency and efficiency.\n*   **AI Agent Integration:** Seamlessly interact with external command-line AI agents (e.g., Gemini) to process your contexts and generate responses.\n*   **Watch Mode:** Automatically re-execute contexts upon file changes, enabling iterative development and continuous feedback from your AI assistant.\n*   **Project Initialization:** Easily set up `ctx` in any project with a simple initialization command.\n*   **Version Control Friendly:** Designed to work hand-in-hand with Git, allowing you to version control your AI interactions and workflows.\n\n## Installation\n```bash\n# Instructions on how to install ctx (e.g., cargo install, download binary)\n# Example:\n# cargo install ctx\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n### Initializing a Project\nTo start using `ctx` in your project, navigate to your project's root directory and run:\n```bash\nctx init\n```\nThis will create a `.ctx` directory where all your contexts and snippets will be stored.\n\n### Context Management\n\n#### Creating a New Context\n```bash\nctx context new <context_name>\n# For a daily diary context:\nctx context new --diary\n```\n\n#### Executing a Context\n```bash\nctx context execute <context_name>\n```\n\n#### Listing Contexts\n```bash\nctx context list\n```\n\n### Snippet Management\n\n#### Creating a New Snippet\n```bash\nctx snippet new <snippet_name>\n```\n\n#### Listing Snippets\n```bash\nctx snippet list\n```\n\n### Watch Mode\nMonitor a context for changes and automatically re-execute it:\n```bash\nctx watch <context_name>\n```\n\n## Core Concepts\n\n### Contexts\nContexts are markdown files that encapsulate a specific task or set of instructions for an AI agent. They can include other contexts or snippets using special directives (e.g., `@include`, `@summary`, `@inline`, `@answer`).\n\n### Snippets\nSnippets are reusable markdown fragments that can be embedded into contexts. They are ideal for common prompts, code examples, or boilerplate text.\n\n### AI Agent Integration\n`ctx` interacts with external AI agents by executing a predefined shell command. Currently, it's configured to use the Gemini CLI.\n\n## Configuration\n`ctx` can be configured via environment variables or a configuration file (details to be added).\n\n## Contributing\nWe welcome contributions!
