This project shows using @answer with choose option to generate a simple script, that will format a chosen hard drive.
Of course the script is NOT then executed by vespe, it's just an automation example!

.vespe/contexts/main.md							    - this is the context as it is before being answered

.vespe/contexts/main_executed.md					- this is the same context after an example execution 

.vespe/contexts/deadly_script.bat.example           - this is an output script that, if executed, will format the choosen hard drive
