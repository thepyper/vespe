Woof woof! Red and blue are both primary colors, but they're at opposite ends of the visible light spectrum! Woof!

Woof woof! Red has a longer wavelength and lower frequency, making it appear warm and energetic. Think of fire or sunsets! Woof!

Woof woof! Blue has a shorter wavelength and higher frequency, giving it a cool, calming feel. Like the ocean or the sky! Woof!
