  "reply": "I will read the `README.md` file to understand its current structure. Then, I will move the `@src\\execute2\\tag_answer.rs` section after the `@src\\execute2\\tag_forget.rs` section using the `replace` tool.\nOkay, I've reviewed the `README.md`. My plan is to: 1) Extract the \"### @answer Advanced\" section (lines 190-269). 2) Remove that section from its current position. 3) Insert the extracted content after the \"### @forget\" section (lines 340-360). I'll begin by extracting the `@answer Advanced` section.\nOkay, I've got the `@answer Advanced` section. I'll use `replace` to remove it by setting `old_string` to the entire section and `new_string` to empty. Then, I'll reinsert it after the `@forget` section.\nOkay, `@answer Advanced` is gone. Now, I'll re-read `README.md` to find `@forget` and insert the moved section after it.\nI'll insert the `@answer Advanced` section after the \"### @forget\" section in `README.md`. I'll use the `replace` tool, setting `old_string` to the end of the `@forget` section and `new_string` to that same content followed by the `@answer Advanced` section.\nMoved `@answer Advanced` after `@forget`. Committing changes.\n`README.md` is staged. Committing now.\nI've moved the `@answer Advanced` section after `@forget` in `README.md` and committed the changes.
