## Plan: Handle HTML Escaping in LLM Responses

### Problem Statement:
The LLM's raw responses sometimes contain HTML escaped characters (e.g., `&#x60;` for backticks, `&quot;` for double quotes). The current `JsonMarkdownPolicy::parse_response` is not designed to unescape these characters, leading to parsing failures and incorrect interpretation of the LLM's output. This was observed in `doc/problem002.txt`.

### Diagnosis:
Our `format_query` methods do not perform HTML escaping. The HTML escaping is likely introduced by the `llm` crate's internal LLM client when it serializes the chat messages for the API request. The LLM's response then contains these escaped characters.

### Proposed Solution:
Unescape HTML entities in the LLM's raw response before attempting to parse it with `JsonMarkdownPolicy::parse_response`. This will ensure that the parsing logic receives clean, unescaped markdown and JSON content.

### Detailed Plan:

1.  **Add a dependency for HTML unescaping:**
    *   Search for a suitable Rust crate for HTML unescaping (e.g., `html_escape`).
    *   Add the chosen crate to `Cargo.toml`.

2.  **Modify `src/llm/impls/json_markdown_policy.rs`:**
    *   In the `parse_response` method, before applying regexes or attempting JSON deserialization, unescape the `response` string.
    *   Use the chosen HTML unescaping crate for this purpose.

3.  **Verification:**
    *   Re-run the scenario that generated `doc/problem002.txt`.
    *   Verify that the `LLM Parsed Response` now correctly extracts `tool_code` and `thought` blocks, and that the content within them is unescaped.
    *   Ensure that the LLM's behavior improves due to correct parsing.

### Git Tracking:
*   Each logical step will be committed separately.
