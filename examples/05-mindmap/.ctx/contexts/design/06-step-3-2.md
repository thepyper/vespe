Okay, I will update `src/screens/mod.rs` as requested.
I've created `src/screens/mod.rs` with the `CurrentScreen` enum. Now, to commit.
`tic-crab-toe/src/screens/mod.rs` is modified. Staging, then committing.
File staged. Committing.
Changes committed. Running `git status` to confirm.
Okay, `src/screens/mod.rs` is committed. Now, for Step 3: I'll create `src/screens/splash_screen.rs` with the `SplashScreen` struct, including `start_time`, `animation_frame`, `new`, `is_finished`, and `update_animation` methods. This will encapsulate splash screen logic. I'll use the provided content.
`src/screens/splash_screen.rs` created. Committing.
`tic-crab-toe/src/screens/splash_screen.rs` is untracked. I'll stage and commit it.
File staged. Committing.
Changes committed. Running `git status` to confirm.
Okay, `splash_screen.rs` is committed. Next, I'll update `src/screens/mod.rs` by adding `pub mod splash_screen;` to export the `SplashScreen` struct, making it accessible for other modules.
Updated `src/screens/mod.rs`. Committing.
`tic-crab-toe/src/screens/mod.rs` and `Cargo.lock` are modified. I'll stage and commit both.
Files staged. Committing.
Changes committed. Running `git status` to confirm.
`src/screens/mod.rs` is committed. Now, for Step 3.5: I'll update `src/app.rs`. I'll add `splash_screen: SplashScreen` and `current_screen: CurrentScreen` fields to the `App` struct, initializing them in `App::new()`. The `update()` method will handle `AppEvent::Tick` to animate the splash screen and transition to `MainMenu` after 5 seconds. I'll read `src/app.rs` first to locate the correct insertion points.
Okay, I've reviewed `src/app.rs`. I'll now modify it: adding `use crate::screens::splash_screen::SplashScreen;`, changing `current_screen` to `CurrentScreen::SplashScreen`, adding `pub splash_screen: SplashScreen` to `App`, initializing `splash_screen: SplashScreen::new()` in `App::new()`, and updating the `update` method for `SplashScreen` logic.
Updated `src/app.rs`. Committing.
`tic-crab-toe/src/app.rs` is modified. Staging, then committing.
File staged. Committing.
Changes committed. Running `git status` to confirm.
`src/app.rs` is committed. Now, for Step 3.6, I'll update `src/ui.rs`. I'll read its content, then modify it to render the `SplashScreen` when `app.current_screen` is `CurrentScreen::SplashScreen`, calling `splash_screen::render` and passing the `Frame` and `App` state.
I assumed `src/ui.rs` existed, but it doesn't. I'll create it now. First, I'll make the file with a basic rendering structure. Then, I'll add the logic to render the `SplashScreen` when `app.current_screen` is `CurrentScreen::SplashScreen`, calling `splash_screen::render`.
`src/ui.rs` created. Committing.
`tic-crab-toe/src/ui.rs` is untracked. I'll stage and commit it.
File staged. Committing.
Changes committed. Running `git status` to confirm.
`src/ui.rs` is committed. Now, for Step 3.7, I'll implement the `splash_screen::render` function. I'll add a `render` function to `src/screens/splash_screen.rs` that takes a `Frame` and `App` reference, drawing ASCII art to the terminal using `ratatui` widgets. This function will handle the visual representation of the splash screen.
Updated `src/screens/splash_screen.rs`. Committing.
