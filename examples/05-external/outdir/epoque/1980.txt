(A slow, deliberate sigh, like the settling of dust in an old photograph)

Right then. Let me see... It’s been a bit… complicated, you see. It all started with this little village in Vermont. They call it Havenwood. It’s a place that’s always been quiet, nestled up near the Green Mountains. Now, there’s this… *boy*, named Finn. He’s a woodsman, really, but he’s got a knack for things you wouldn't expect.

He’s been… experimenting. With stones, with the way the sunlight falls on the moss. He’s been building a series of resonators, little boxes that amplify the natural vibrations of the land. It’s supposed to… enhance the forest, you know, make it bloom brighter. But lately... lately, it’s been *changing*. 

The trees… they’re shifting. Not like a gentle breeze, no. It's more like a… a whisper. And the ground around the resonators… it's getting warmer. Like a summer day, but… deeper. And last night, I saw it. A flicker. A shadow. It wasn't an animal. It just... *wavered* for a moment, and the air itself felt… strained. Like the music in a really old recording. 

The elders are worried. They say it's a sign. A warning. They say things *should* be, but… it doesn’t feel right. Like a song played backwards. 

It’s unsettling, really. A little unsettling, even for a young man like me.
