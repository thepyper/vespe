I want to restructure my README.md.
All the information inside is correct, I just want to change some things.

@set { provider: 'gemini -y -m gemini-2.5-flash' }

I want to split the @answer tag documentation into 2 sections:
- @answer
- @answer advanced

The second section will contain everything but the simplest parameters (provider).

I need to restructure the documentation for the `@answer` tag in `src/execute2/tag_answer.rs`. I will split it into two sections: a basic one and an advanced one. The advanced section will contain all parameters except the simplest ones (like `provider`).

First, I will read the content of `src/execute2/tag_answer.rs` to understand the current documentation.
The `src/execute2/tag_answer.rs` file lacks the `@answer` tag parameter documentation. I suspect this documentation resides in `README.md`, as the user wants to restructure it. I will now read `README.md` to locate it.
I've located the `@answer` tag documentation in `README.md`. My plan is to extract this section, then divide it into "Basic" and "Advanced" parameter descriptions. "Basic" will cover `provider` and `dynamic`, while "Advanced" will include `input`, `input_data`, `prefix`, `prefix_data`, `postfix`, `postfix_data`, `output`, and `choose`. Finally, I'll replace the original `@answer` section with these two new, distinct sections in `README.md`.
Updated `README.md` by splitting `@answer` tag documentation. Committing changes now.
`README.md` is modified. Untracked files and a diary entry exist, but I'll ignore them. Staging `README.md` now for commit.
`README.md` is staged. Committing with a descriptive message.
Changes committed. `README.md` restructured. Task complete.
`README.md` changes are committed, as confirmed by `git status`. Other files are irrelevant to this task. I've finished restructuring `README.md`. I am done.
The `README.md` has been successfully updated and the changes committed.
I am done with the task.

Now I want the @answer advanced section to be moved after the @forget section.
