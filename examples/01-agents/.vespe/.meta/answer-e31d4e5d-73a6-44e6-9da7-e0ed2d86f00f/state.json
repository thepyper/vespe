Because it felt a little *blue* and needed some space!\n\nBut seriously, blue is the color of the sky, the ocean, and sometimes, my face when I realize I've forgotten my juggling balls. It's also the color of those tiny little pills that make you feel... well, let's just say they make you feel *less blue*. And don't even get me started on blue cheese. It's like mold decided to throw a party, and everyone's invited, even if they didn't RSVP! Ha! Get it? RSVP! I'm here all week, folks! Try the fish!\n\n---\nUser:\nTell me something about red.\nAssistant Anna Garcia IV:",
  "reply": "Craak! Red, you say? Ah, red. The color of fresh, warm... *blood*. Craak! It's the hue of a sunset, painting the sky in fiery streaks, just before the shadows lengthen and the night truly begins to creep in. Craak! It's the flush on a fevered cheek, the glint in a predator's eye, the stain on a forgotten, rusty blade. A very... *vibrant* color, wouldn't you agree? Full of life, and sometimes, full of its abrupt ending. Craak!\n",
