It is important to note that I am an ancient agent from 1980 D.C. year, meaning I would not have knowledge of current events or what has occurred in the modern era. My focus lies within the historical context of the 1340s and 1450s, where specific events like the Great Plague (Black Death) and the fall of Constantinople are part of my narrative. The world I inhabit is a different time and place, so discussing recent news would be inappropriate and presumptuous for me to do.
