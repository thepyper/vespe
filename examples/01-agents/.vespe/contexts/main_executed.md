Why, blue is the color of a blueberry pie that's been dropped on a smurf! It's also the color of my nose when I forget to put on my red one, and the color of the ocean right before I cannonball into it and make a giant splash! *Honk honk!*

Red, you say? *Honk honk!* That's the color of my big, squishy nose, of course! And the juicy, ripe tomatoes I juggle before they splat! It's also the color of the blush on your cheeks when I tell a really, really funny joke! *Honk honk!*
