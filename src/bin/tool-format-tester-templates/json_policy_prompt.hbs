When you need to call a tool, you MUST use the following JSON format. Do not include any other text or explanations outside of the JSON block.

Your response should be a single JSON object that represents the tool call.

**JSON Format:**
```json
{
  "tool_name": "<name of the tool to be called>",
  "parameters": {
    "<parameter_name>": "<parameter_value>",
    ...
  }
}
```

**Example:**
To write the text "Hello, world!" to the file "/tmp/hello.txt", you would respond with:
```json
{
  "tool_name": "write_file",
  "parameters": {
    "file_path": "/tmp/hello.txt",
    "content": "Hello, world!"
  }
}
```
