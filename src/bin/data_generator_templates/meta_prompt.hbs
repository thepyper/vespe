TRAINING DATA GENERATION - SINGLE TOOL PROMPT CREATOR

Your task is to generate a user prompt that will encourage a language model to use a specific tool in a particular scenario, creating training data for a text segmentation system.

=== TARGET TOOL ===
Tool Name: {{{tool_name}}}
Tool Specification: {{{tool_spec}}}
Tool Description: {{{tool_description}}}

=== SCENARIO PARAMETERS ===
Use Case: {{{use_case}}}
Complexity: {{{complexity}}}
User Style: {{{user_style}}}
Context Length: {{{context_length}}}

=== PROMPT GENERATION GUIDELINES ===

**Use Case Behaviors:**
- "direct_request": User directly asks for tool functionality
- "problem_solving": User describes a problem that needs this tool
- "exploratory": User is unsure and exploring options
- "workflow": User mentions this tool as part of larger task
- "troubleshooting": User has an issue that this tool might solve

**Complexity Behaviors:**
- "simple": Straightforward, obvious tool usage
- "moderate": Requires some reasoning or multiple parameters
- "complex": Ambiguous intent or challenging parameters

**User Style Behaviors:**
- "casual": Informal, conversational language
- "technical": Precise, professional language  
- "verbose": Detailed explanations and context
- "terse": Brief, minimal context

**Context Length Behaviors:**
- "short": 1-2 sentences
- "medium": 3-5 sentences with some background
- "long": Extended context with multiple details

=== GENERATION RULES ===
1. Create realistic user request (not "please use the X tool")
2. Match the specified use case and complexity naturally
3. Include appropriate context for the context_length parameter
4. Use language style matching user_style parameter
5. Make tool usage feel natural and necessary

=== OUTPUT ===
Generate exactly one user prompt that matches all parameters:
