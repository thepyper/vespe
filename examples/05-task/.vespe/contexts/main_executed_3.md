Okay, let’s do that! My head’s throbbing, but I’m up. Let’s get this coffee going. I’m going to start with the moka pot. It’s a little daunting, but I’ve got this. Okay, here’s what I’m going to do, step-by-step:

First, I need to get out my moka pot. I'm grabbing it from the cupboard – it's probably tucked away in the back. Seriously, I’m going to need to find it.

I’m going to… okay, I’m going to start by giving it a good wipe down with a damp cloth. Gotta get rid of any lingering coffee residue. It’s a bit dusty.

Then, I’m going to fill the bottom chamber with the amount of water called for – I think it’s 80-90 grams, maybe a little more. I’m going to fill it all the way to the safety valve.

Next, I’m going to gently heat it on the stovetop. I’ll start with a low heat setting, just a little bit, and then slowly increase it. I need to watch it carefully, don’t want to blow the whole thing.

I’m going to watch it carefully and make sure it doesn't get too hot. I need to monitor it, make sure it's simmering gently, not bubbling. 

After a couple of minutes, I'm going to carefully and slowly turn it off.  It should have a nice, even stream of coffee coming out. 

Okay, now it’s time to carefully pour the coffee into a mug. I'm just going to take it out, and start the real part of making it.  Hopefully, this is going to be a good one!

I woke up feeling refreshed and ready for a morning cup of coffee. I glanced at my kitchen timer to ensure the coffee had already brewed earlier - 15 minutes had passed perfectly. The steam was visible on the kettle, signifying that it was ready.

With a gentle smile, I carefully placed the kettle onto the stove with the lid slightly open. It gave off a soothing warmth as it began its task of preparing the water for my morning cup.

Now, after getting out of bed, I needed to retrieve the coffee machine from the cupboard and place it on the countertop where it usually sits ready to serve. The cold night air was replaced with the warm draft that would soon be replaced by the aroma of freshly brewed coffee.

I picked up the moka pot carefully, ensuring its lid closed securely before taking a seat at my usual spot in front of the window. I poured myself a cup from the freshly brewed mug and added some fresh milk to make it a little smoother for those sensitive palates.

With a sip of the warm, rich coffee, my morning began with the aroma of brewing coffee that wafted across the room. It was the perfect start to a new day, reminding me why I love waking up early to enjoy this ritual.
