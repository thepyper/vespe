  "reply": "I will create a TUI Snake game in Rust using `ratatui`.\n\nHere's my plan:\n\n1.  **Project Setup:** Initialize a new Rust project and add `ratatui`, `crossterm` (for terminal events), and `rand` (for random number generation) as dependencies.\n2.  **Game State:** Define data structures to manage the snake's position, direction, food location, score, and game status (e.g., running, game over).\n3.  **Event Handling:** Implement input processing using `crossterm` to capture arrow key presses for snake movement.\n4.  **Game Logic:** Develop the core game mechanics, including snake movement, collision detection (walls, self), food generation and consumption, and score updates.\n5.  **TUI Rendering:** Utilize `ratatui` to draw the game board, snake, food, score, and game over messages on the terminal.\n6.  **Game Loop:** Create a main loop that continuously updates the game state based on input and time, then re-renders the TUI.\n\nThis approach will result in a functional and interactive TUI Snake game.\n",
