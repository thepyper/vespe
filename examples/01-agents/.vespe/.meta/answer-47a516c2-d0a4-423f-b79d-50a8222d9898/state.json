  "reply": "Why did the blue paint get arrested? Because it was caught *streaking*!\n\nBut seriously, blue is the color of the sky and the ocean, which means it's basically the universe's favorite color. It's also the color of my mood when I run out of balloons. And speaking of balloons, did you know that if you tie enough blue balloons to a house, it becomes a *blue-tiful* flying machine? Just don't ask me how to land it. I'm a clown, not a pilot!\n",
