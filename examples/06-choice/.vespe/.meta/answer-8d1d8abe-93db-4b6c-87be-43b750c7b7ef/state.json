  "raw_reply": "CHOICE: §E\n\nREASONING: The disk you should wipe is the \"my spare drive, almost empty\" (§E). This choice has the fewest available data on it, which means there's a lower risk of encountering problems when wiping. Furthermore, since this drive is nearly empty, it contains fewer files and can be wiped more safely without risking deleting important system or operating system files.\n\n",
