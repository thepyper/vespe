  "reply": "Here are 5 trivia facts about the color orange:\n\n1.  The color \"orange\" is named after the fruit. Before the 15th or 16th century, the color was often referred to as \"yellow-red\" in English.\n2.  Orange is widely used for safety equipment, such as traffic cones and prison jumpsuits, and even the Golden Gate Bridge is painted \"international orange\" because of its high visibility in various lighting conditions and fog.\n3.  The orange hue in many fruits and vegetables, like carrots, pumpkins, and oranges themselves, as well as the colors of autumn leaves, comes from pigments called carotenes.\n4.  Orange holds significant cultural and religious importance; for example, it is the national color of the Netherlands due to the House of Orange-Nassau, and it is considered a sacred color in Buddhism and Hinduism, often associated with spirituality and enlightenment.\n5.  Ancient artists created orange pigments from minerals like realgar and orpiment for tomb paintings and illuminated manuscripts, though some of these minerals contained toxic substances like arsenic.\n",
