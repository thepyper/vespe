Alright, my friend, pull up a chair and listen to this! Just last year, in '79, we saw some real shake-ups. The Shah of Iran, he was out, and Ayatollah Khomeini, he was in. That whole revolution changed the game over there. And get this, the Soviets, they rolled into Afghanistan! Big news, real big. The world's a-changin' fast, I tell ya!
