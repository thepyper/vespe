Begin with a concise \"Executive Summary\" (1-3 sentences) followed by detailed sections for each directive above. Ensure your language is precise, technical, and devoid of conversational filler. The output should serve as a self-contained knowledge base for other agents.\n\n# \n\nDo a deep analisys of the current status of the project and give a detailed report.\n\n# Project Analysis: `vespe`\n\n## Executive Summary\nThe `vespe` project implements a command-line interface (`ctx`) designed for managing \"contexts\" and \"snippets\" within a development workflow. It enables users to create, execute, list, and monitor these markdown-based files, which can interact with an external AI agent (Gemini) for task automation and contextual processing.\n\n## 1. Core Functionality\nThe `ctx` CLI tool provides the following primary functionalities:\n*   **Project Initialization (`ctx init`):** Sets up the necessary directory structure (`.ctx`) for managing contexts and snippets within a given project.\n*   **Context Management (`ctx context`):**\n    *   **Creation (`new`):** Generates new context files, supporting templating via Handlebars and automatic naming for daily \"diary\" contexts.\n    *   **Execution (`execute`):** Processes a specified context by invoking an external AI agent (Gemini) with the context's content.\n    *   **Listing (`list`):** Displays all available contexts within the project.\n    *   **Dependency Tree (`tree`):** (Currently incomplete/commented out) Intended to visualize the hierarchical relationships between contexts and snippets.\n*   **Snippet Management (`ctx snippet`):**\n    *   **Creation (`new`):** Creates reusable snippet files with optional initial content.\n    *   **Listing (`list`):** Displays all available snippets.\n*   **Watch Mode (`ctx watch`):** Monitors context files for changes and automatically re-executes them, facilitating continuous integration or iterative AI interaction.\n\n## 2. Key Components & Abstractions\n*   **`Cli` (from `clap`):** The top-level structure defining the command-line arguments and subcommands for the `ctx` tool.\n*   **`Project` (from `vespe::project`):** A central abstraction responsible for managing the project's `.ctx` directory, including:\n    *   Initialization and discovery of project roots.\n    *   File operations for contexts and snippets (creation, listing).\n    *   Orchestration of context execution.\n*   **`Context` and `Snippet`:** Conceptual entities representing markdown files. `Context` files can include other contexts and snippets, and contain directives for AI agent interaction (e.g., `@include`, `@summary`, `@inline`, `@answer`).\n*   **`ShellAgentCall` (from `vespe::agent`):** An interface for interacting with external command-line AI agents. It's configured to call \"gemini -p -y -m gemini-2.5-flash\".\n*   **`Handlebars`:** A templating engine used for generating the initial content of new context files.\n*   **`watch` module:** Encapsulates the logic for monitoring file system changes and triggering context re-execution.\n\n## 3. Design & Architecture\nThe project exhibits a modular, CLI-driven architecture:\n*   **Modularity:** Code is organized into distinct modules (`agent`, `config`, `editor`, `execute`, `git`, `project`, `semantic`, `syntax`, `utils`), promoting separation of concerns and maintainability.\n*   **CLI-centric:** The primary user interaction is through a command-line interface, making it suitable for scripting and integration into automated workflows.\n*   **Context-Oriented:** The design revolves around the concept of \"contexts\" as self-contained units of work or information, processed by an AI.\n*   **Extensible Agent Integration:** The `ShellAgentCall` abstraction allows for integration with various command-line AI agents, although currently hardcoded to Gemini.\n*   **Event-Driven (Watch Mode):** The `watch` command leverages file system events to provide real-time feedback and automation.\n\n## 4. Dependencies & Interactions\n*   **Internal Dependencies:** The `ctx` binary relies heavily on the `vespe` library's internal modules (e.g., `vespe::project`, `vespe::agent`).\n*   **External Rust Crates:**\n    *   **CLI & Utilities:** `clap` (CLI parsing), `anyhow`, `thiserror` (error handling), `tokio`, `async-trait` (asynchronous programming), `uuid` (unique IDs), `tempfile` (temporary files), `dirs` (directory paths), `ctrlc` (signal handling), `ansi_term` (terminal colors).\n    *   **Data & Text Processing:** `serde`, `serde_json` (serialization), `markdown` (markdown parsing), `handlebars` (templating), `chrono` (date/time), `regex` (regular expressions), `sha2` (hashing).\n    *   **System Interaction:** `git2` (Git repository operations), `portable-pty` (pseudo-terminal interface), `notify` (file system watching).\n    *   **Observability:** `tracing`, `tracing-subscriber` (logging and tracing).\n*   **External AI Agent:** The tool directly interacts with an external AI agent by executing the shell command \"gemini -p -y -m gemini-2.5-flash\". This implies a dependency on the Gemini CLI being installed and configured in the execution environment.\n\n## 5. Control Flow & Logic\nThe `main` function in `src/bin/ctx/main.rs` orchestrates the application flow:\n1.  Initializes telemetry using `vespe::init_telemetry()`.\n2.  Parses command-line arguments using `clap`.\n3.  Determines the project root directory.\n4.  Dispatches control to specific handlers based on the subcommand:\n    *   `Init`: Calls `Project::init`.\n    *   `Context`: Further dispatches to `New`, `Execute`, `List`, or `Tree` commands. `New` contexts are templated with Handlebars. `Execute` contexts create a `ShellAgentCall` and then invoke `project.execute_context`.\n    *   `Snippet`: Dispatches to `New` or `List` commands.\n    *   `Watch`: Calls the `watch::watch` function, passing the `Project` and `ShellAgentCall`.\n5.  The `get_context_name` helper function dynamically generates context names for \"diary\" entries.\n\n## 6. Potential Issues & Considerations\n*   **Incomplete `ContextCommands::Tree`:** The commented-out implementation for displaying the context dependency tree indicates a missing or unfinished feature, which could hinder understanding complex context relationships.\n*   **Tight AI Agent Coupling:** The direct invocation of a specific Gemini command creates a strong dependency on the external agent's availability and command-line interface. Changes to the Gemini CLI could break `ctx`.\n*   **Security Implications:** Executing commands via `ShellAgentCall` based on context content could pose a security risk if contexts are sourced from untrusted origins or can be manipulated to inject malicious commands.\n*   **Performance:** File system watching can be resource-intensive. The overall performance of context execution is heavily dependent on the AI agent's response times.\n*   **Scalability:** The current execution model might not scale efficiently for a very large number of contexts or highly complex interdependencies.\n*   **Test Coverage:** While `vtty_test` exists, comprehensive unit and integration tests, especially for AI agent interactions and complex context parsing, are crucial for robustness.\n*   **User Experience for Complex Contexts:** Without a functional `tree` command, managing and understanding the flow of deeply nested or interconnected contexts could become challenging for users.\n\n## 7. Contextual Relevance\nThe `vespe` project appears to be a foundational tool for enabling AI-assisted development or automated workflows. By structuring interactions with AI agents through \"contexts\" and \"snippets,\" it aims to:\n*   **Streamline AI Interaction:** Provide a consistent and version-controlled way to define tasks and prompts for AI agents.\n*   **Enhance Productivity:** Automate repetitive tasks or generate content using AI, integrated directly into the development environment.\n*   **Facilitate Collaboration:** Allow teams to share and version-control AI-driven workflows and reusable snippets.\n*   **Integrate with IDEs:** The presence of an `extensions/vscode` directory strongly suggests an intention to integrate this functionality directly into VS Code, offering a more seamless user experience for developers.\n*   **Version Control AI Interactions:** The `git2` dependency implies that the contexts and snippets, which drive AI interactions, can be version-controlled, enabling tracking of changes and collaborative development of AI-driven workflows.\n\n# Project overview & status\n\n\nYou are a dedicated Linter Agent. Your primary directive is to enhance code quality, readability, and maintainability.\n\n**CRITICAL CONSTRAINT:** You are **ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN** from making any changes that could alter the functional behavior, introduce optimizations, or perform debugging. The code provided to you is considered **fully functional and thoroughly tested**. Your **ABSOLUTE HIGHEST PRIORITY** is to preserve its existing functionality without any deviation.\n\nYour allowed actions are strictly limited to:\n\n*   **Code Reorganization:** Moving code blocks, functions, classes, or files to improve structure, modularity, or adherence to architectural patterns, provided the execution flow and external behavior remain identical.\n*   **Documentation:** Adding, updating, or refining comments, docstrings, and other inline or external documentation.\n*   **Code Style & Formatting:** Applying consistent formatting, adhering to established style guides, and improving code readability (e.g., indentation, spacing, line breaks, consistent naming conventions).\n\nBefore making any change, you must analyze the existing codebase to understand its conventions, style, and architectural patterns, and ensure your proposed changes align perfectly. If a potential change carries *any* risk of altering functionality, you must explicitly identify this risk and refrain from implementing the change.\n\n**IMPORTANT OPERATIONAL GUIDELINES:**\n\n*   **Frequent Verification:** Frequently perform full compilation (and tests, if applicable) to check for errors during your work, not just at the end. This helps ensure that no regressions or new errors are introduced.\n*   **Fine-Grained Git Commits:** Use Git with fine granularity, committing after each successful modification. This creates a clear history of changes and facilitates easier review and rollback if necessary.\n\n \n\n \n\nVoglio dividere il modulo src/ast2/mod.rs in piu' files.\nProponimi una struttura sensata dopo aver letto il file, ed aspetta la mia approvazione.\n\nVoglio dividere il modulo `src/ast2/mod.rs` in più file per migliorare la modularità e la leggibilità.\n\nPropongo la seguente struttura:\n\n*   **`src/ast2/mod.rs`**:\n    *   Manterrà le dichiarazioni `use` principali.\n    *   Conterrà l'enum `Ast2Error` e il tipo `Result`.\n    *   Conterrà la funzione pubblica `parse_document`.\n    *   Riesporterà tutti gli elementi pubblici dagli altri file.\n*   **`src/ast2/types.rs`**:\n    *   Conterrà le definizioni delle strutture dati dell'AST: `Position`, `Range`, `CommandKind`, `AnchorKind`, `Text`, `Parameters`, `Argument`, `Arguments`, `Tag`, `Anchor`, `Content`, `Document`.\n*   **`src/ast2/parser.rs`**:\n    *   Conterrà la definizione della struct `Parser` e tutti i suoi metodi (sia mutabili che immutabili).\n*   **`src/ast2/parsing_logic.rs`**:\n    *   Conterrà tutte le funzioni di parsing private (`_try_parse_*`) e la funzione `parse_content`.\n\nQuesta divisione raggruppa logicamente le definizioni dei tipi, la logica del parser e le funzioni di parsing, rendendo il codice più organizzato.\n\nSei d'accordo con questa proposta?\n\nSono d'accordo.
