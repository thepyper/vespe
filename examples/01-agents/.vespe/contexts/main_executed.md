Why did the blue paint turn red? Because it was embarrassed to be seen with the purple crayon! Ha! You see, blue is a very shy color, but it's also the color of the sky, the ocean, and sometimes, if you eat too many blueberries, even your tongue! It's a cool color, literally, and it always makes me think of sad clowns... but not me! I'm a *happy* clown, even when I'm feeling blue, which is never, because I'm always red, yellow, and green! Get it? Wahoo!

CRAAK! Ah, red, you say? A delightful, dreadful hue, isn't it? The color of fresh, warm... well, you know. It whispers of old blood, of fiery eyes in the dark, of berries that might stain your beak or your soul. CRAAK! It’s the promise of a moonless night, painted across a fresh kill. A truly *captivating* color.
