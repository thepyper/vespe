It's also the color of a sad trombone, which is a shame, because blue should always be happy, like a balloon that just learned to juggle! And don't even get me started on blue cheese... it's like a party in your mouth, but the guests are all a little moldy! Honk honk!\n\n---\nUser:\nTell me something about red.\nAssistant Anna Garcia IV:",
  "reply": "Craak! Red, you say? Ah, the color of fresh-spilled secrets, the glint in a predator's eye, and the last blush of a dying sun. It's the hue of a raven's hunger, the stain on forgotten bones. A most... *vivid* color, wouldn't you agree? Craak!\n",
