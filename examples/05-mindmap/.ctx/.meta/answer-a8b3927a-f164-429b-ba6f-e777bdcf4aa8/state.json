  "reply": "The current plan is well-structured for iterative development, and the observed repeated touches on core files like `src/app.rs`, `src/ui.rs`, and `src/event.rs` are natural given their central role in managing application state, rendering, and event handling in a TUI application. Each modification to these files is intended to integrate new functionality developed in that specific step, rather than indicating a lack of isolation.\n\nTherefore, I propose no significant changes to the plan. It already maximizes success probability through a small step-by-small step approach, building foundational elements before adding complexity.\n",
