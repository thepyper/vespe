Read my README.md and give me suggestions to make it better.

The `README.md` is well-structured and provides a good overview of `vespe`. Here are some suggestions to enhance it further:

1.  **Visual Demonstrations:** Consider adding screenshots or short GIFs to illustrate key features, especially the `watch` mode and how `@answer` tags transform the document. This can significantly improve understanding for new users.
2.  **"Why vespe?" Section:** While the "Philosophy" section is good, a dedicated "Why vespe?" or "Motivation" section could explicitly highlight the unique benefits and use cases that differentiate `vespe` from other tools.
3.  **Example Workflow:** Expand the "Getting Started" section into a slightly more complex, real-world example workflow. This could demonstrate how a user might brainstorm, refine, and organize an idea using several `vespe` features.
4.  **Context Organization Best Practices:** Provide some guidance or examples on how to effectively organize "contexts" within the `.vespe` directory for larger projects.
5.  **Advanced Configuration:** If `vespe` supports any global configuration files or environment variables for LLM providers or other settings, mention them and how to use them.
6.  **Troubleshooting/FAQ:** Add a small section addressing common issues or frequently asked questions to help users quickly resolve problems.
7.  **Table of Contents:** For easier navigation, especially as the README grows, a table of contents at the beginning would be beneficial.
8.  **Badges:** Include relevant badges (e.g., build status, version, license) at the top of the README.
9.  **Refine "NO-WARRANTY" Section:** While crucial, the current "NO-WARRANTY" section is quite long and uses all caps. Consider summarizing it more concisely in the README and linking to a separate `DISCLAIMER.md` file for the full legal text, or rephrasing it to be less aggressive while retaining its legal intent.
