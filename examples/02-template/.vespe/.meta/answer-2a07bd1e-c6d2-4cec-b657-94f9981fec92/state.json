Many \"blue\" flowers or animals actually use clever tricks of light and structure to appear blue, rather than containing blue pigments.\n2.  **Expensive Pigment:** Historically, ultramarine blue, derived from the lapis lazuli stone, was one of the most expensive pigments, often reserved for depicting royalty or divine figures.\n3.  **Calming Effect:** Blue is frequently associated with feelings of calm, tranquility, and peace. It's often used in bedrooms and healthcare facilities for this reason.\n4.  **Blue Foods:** Blue is not a common color for natural foods, and blue food coloring can sometimes suppress appetite because our brains don't associate blue with edible items.\n5.  **\"Blue\" in Language:** Many languages historically didn't have a distinct word for blue, often grouping it with green or other dark colors. The perception and naming of blue evolved later in human language and culture.\n\n---\nUser:\nTell me 5 trivia about color orange.\n\nAssistant:\nHere are 5 trivia facts about the color orange:\n\n1.  **Named After the Fruit:** Unlike most colors, \"orange\" is unique in that it was named after the fruit, not the other way around. The word \"orange\" for the color first appeared in English in the early 16th century, replacing the older term \"geoluhread\" (yellow-red).\n2.  **Associated with Autumn:** Orange is strongly linked to the autumn season, Halloween, and Thanksgiving, thanks to the color of changing leaves, pumpkins, and harvest.\n3.  **High Visibility:** Orange is one of the most visible colors in daylight, which is why it's often used for safety equipment like traffic cones, life rafts, and high-visibility clothing.\n4.  **No Blue Complement:** Orange is the complementary color to blue on the color wheel. This means that when placed next to each other, they create a strong contrast and make each other appear brighter.\n5.  **Symbolism:** In many cultures, orange symbolizes enthusiasm, creativity, determination, happiness, and success. In some Eastern religions, it's considered a sacred and spiritual color.\n\n---\nUser:\nTell me 5 trivia about color aquamarine.\n",
