Here are some suggestions to improve your `README.md` file:

1.  **Add a "Why Vespe?" or "Motivation" Section:** Explain the unique benefits of `vespe` compared to other tools, highlighting its collaborative mind-mapping and dynamic canvas approach with LLMs.
2.  **Include Visuals (Screenshots/GIFs):** Visual demonstrations of `vespe` in action (e.g., `watch` mode, `@answer` tag transformation, `@task` usage) would significantly enhance engagement and understanding.
3.  **Add a Table of Contents:** For a comprehensive README like this, a Table of Contents at the beginning would greatly improve navigation.
4.  **Create a Quick Reference/Cheatsheet for Tags:** A concise table summarizing each tag's purpose and a minimal example would be useful for quick lookups.
5.  **Introduce an "Advanced Usage" or "Best Practices" Section:** Cover topics like error handling, debugging prompts, performance considerations, and potential integrations with editors/IDEs.
6.  **Add a Community/Support Section:** If available, include links to community forums, Discord channels, or other support resources.
7.  **Consider a Future Plans/Roadmap Section (Optional):** Briefly outlining future developments can generate interest.
8.  **Refine "NO-WARRANTY" Placement:** Consider moving this section closer to the "License" or into a dedicated "Disclaimer" section at the end to improve flow.
9.  **Ensure Consistent Code Block Highlighting:** Verify that all code blocks use appropriate language highlighting (e.g., `shell`, `markdown`).
10. **Clarify "Context" vs. "Document" Usage:** While "context" is a core concept, consistent terminology or a clear distinction between "context" and "document" could improve clarity.
11. **Provide a Slightly More Complex "Getting Started" Example:** An example that incorporates `@include` or `@set` could better showcase `vespe`'s power early on.
