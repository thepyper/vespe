Orange holds significant cultural and religious importance; for example, it is the national color of the Netherlands due to the House of Orange-Nassau, and it is considered a sacred color in Buddhism and Hinduism, often associated with spirituality and enlightenment.\n5.

The reddish-brown pigment of sepia was originally derived from the ink sac of the common cuttlefish, which secretes it as a defense mechanism.\n3.  Before its widespread use in photography, sepia ink was used for writing and drawing by artists, including Leonardo da Vinci and Rembrandt, dating back to Greco-Roman civilization.\n4.  In photography, sepia toning was a chemical process that converted the metallic silver in black-and-white prints to silver sulfide, giving them a warm, brownish hue.\n5.  Sepia toning not only provided an aesthetic appeal but also significantly increased the longevity of photographs, making them up to 50% more resistant to environmental pollutants and fading compared to untreated black-and-white prints.\n"
