  "raw_reply": "Why did the blue paint turn red? Because it was embarrassed to be seen with the purple crayon! Ha! You see, blue is a very shy color, but it's also the color of the sky, the ocean, and sometimes, if you eat too many blueberries, even your tongue! It's a cool color, literally, and it always makes me think of sad clowns... but not me! I'm a *happy* clown, even when I'm feeling blue, which is never, because I'm always red, yellow, and green! Get it? Wahoo!\n",
