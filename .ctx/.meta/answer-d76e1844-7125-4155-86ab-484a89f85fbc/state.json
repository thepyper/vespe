  "reply": "\nThe `vespe` project is a Rust-based command-line interface (CLI) tool named `ctx` designed for managing and executing dynamic text \"contexts.\"\n\nAt its core, `ctx` parses special text files (contexts) that contain custom \"tags\" (e.g., `@include`, `@set`, `@answer`) and \"anchors\" (HTML-like comments, `<!-- ... -->`). These elements drive an execution engine that can:\n\n*   **Include other files:** `@include`\n*   **Set variables:** `@set`\n*   **Interact with external AI models:** Commands like `@answer` send queries to models (configured via a `provider`) and inject the responses back into the document. The system manages the state of these multi-step interactions.\n*   **Control flow:** Other commands like `@repeat`, `@decide`, `@choose`, and `@derive` suggest advanced logic for conditional processing and content transformation.\n\nThe `ctx` CLI provides commands to `init`ialize projects, `new` contexts (with templating support), `execute` contexts, `list` them, and even `watch` for changes to automatically re-process files. The project relies on a custom Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) for parsing and a sophisticated multi-pass execution strategy to handle dynamic content generation and integration with external services.\n"
