I want to do some changed to my README.md.
All of the information here is correct and useful, I only want to restructure a bit.

@set {
    provider: 'gemini -y -m gemini-2.5-flash',
    prefix: agent/man_writer
}

<!-- task-7beeec56-303a-4e93-a228-a6cfab5464ec:begin {
	provider: 'gemini -y -m gemini-2.5-flash',
	prefix: agent/man_writer
}  -->

I want the explanation of dynamic answers to go in the @answer advanced section, not in the basic one.

I understand you want to reorganize the `README.md` file by moving the "dynamic answers" explanation to the advanced section. I will begin by reading the `README.md` file to understand its current structure and identify the relevant sections.
I've reviewed the `README.md` and located the "Dynamic Answers" section. My plan is to move this block from its current position under the basic `@answer` tag to the "Multiple Choices" subsection within the "Advanced" section.
Okay, "Dynamic Answers" block removed. Now, I'll insert it into the "Advanced" section, specifically after the "Multiple Choices" example.
Moved "Dynamic Answers" to the advanced section of `README.md`. Committing changes.
Committing changes now.
Changes committed. Request fulfilled. Running `git status` to verify.
Untracked files and a modified diary entry exist, but they're unrelated to the `README.md` task. I've moved the "Dynamic Answers" explanation and committed the changes, so the core request is complete.
`git status` confirms `README.md` is clean; other changes are irrelevant. I've moved the "Dynamic Answers" explanation and committed. Request complete.

Now I want the @answer advanced section to be moved after the @forget section.

I will read the `README.md` file to understand its current structure. Then, I will move the `@src\execute2\tag_answer.rs` section after the `@src\execute2\tag_forget.rs` section using the `replace` tool.
Okay, I've reviewed the `README.md`. My plan is to: 1) Extract the "### @answer Advanced" section (lines 190-269). 2) Remove that section from its current position. 3) Insert the extracted content after the "### @forget" section (lines 340-360). I'll begin by extracting the `@answer Advanced` section.
Okay, I've got the `@answer Advanced` section. I'll use `replace` to remove it by setting `old_string` to the entire section and `new_string` to empty. Then, I'll reinsert it after the `@forget` section.
Okay, `@answer Advanced` is gone. Now, I'll re-read `README.md` to find `@forget` and insert the moved section after it.
I'll insert the `@answer Advanced` section after the "### @forget" section in `README.md`. I'll use the `replace` tool, setting `old_string` to the end of the `@forget` section and `new_string` to that same content followed by the `@answer Advanced` section.
Moved `@answer Advanced` after `@forget`. Committing changes.
`README.md` is staged. Committing now.
I've moved the `@answer Advanced` section after `@forget` in `README.md` and committed the changes. Request complete.
Unstaged changes in `.vespe/contexts/diary/2025-11-11.md` and an untracked `.vespe/.meta/answer-ce71b94f-8a38-457d-8cbc-f28de31e769f/` are unrelated to my `README.md` modification and appear to be temporary `vespe` files, so I'll disregard them. The `README.md` section move is complete and committed. I'm finished.
