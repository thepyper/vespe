  "reply": "Okay, I'll check the `README.md` for any remaining TODOs and complete them.\nOkay, I'll document the `@task` and `@done` tags. I'll start by examining the `examples/05-task` directory to understand their usage, then I'll write the documentation, replace the TODO in `README.md`, and commit the changes. First, I'll list the files in the example directory.\nRight, `examples/05-task` has a `.ctx` directory. I'll check `.ctx/contexts` for the context files.\nAlright, multiple files. I'll start with `main.md` to see how `@task` and `@done` work.\n`main.md` is just a list. I'll check `main_1.md`; it likely holds the initial state with the `@task` tag.\n`main_1.md` shows `@task` starts a sequence. I'm on \"1. Open moka,\" using `@answer` for LLM output. `@done` follows. Now checking `main_executed_1.md` to see what `@done` does.\nOkay, `main_executed_1.md` shows `@task` and `@answer` are now anchors, `@done` is gone. Now, checking `main_2.md` for step two's implementation.\nOkay, `main_executed_2.md` next.\nI understand the `@task`/`@done` workflow. You initiate a task list with `@task`, then use `@answer` and `@done` to execute steps sequentially. `ctx` creates a `@task` anchor, and `@done` moves the completed step within that anchor, effectively hiding it from the LLM's context for subsequent steps. This maintains focus on the current action. I'll now replace the TODO in `README.md` with the documentation I've drafted explaining this process.\n`README.md` is updated. Now, I'll commit: `git add`, `git commit`, `git status`.\nFile staged. Committing with description.\nCommitted. Running `git status`.\nI have completed the documentation for the `@task` and `@done` tags in the `README.md` file, as you requested. By analyzing the project's examples, I was able to provide a clear and comprehensive explanation of how these tags work for managing sequential tasks. The changes have been committed to your project's repository.\n\nIs there anything else I can help you with?\n",
