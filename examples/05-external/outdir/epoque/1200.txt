Marvellous tidings, friend! Just yesternight, word reached us of the founding of the great University of Paris. Aye, King Philip himself, with charter and seal, has brought forth a place where scholars shall gather and wisdom shall flow like a river! 'Tis a grand step for learning, and one that shall surely bring much light to our darkened world. May God bless this endeavor and all who seek knowledge within its hallowed halls.
