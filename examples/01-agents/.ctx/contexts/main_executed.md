Tell me something about blue.

Why, blue is the color of the sky, the ocean, and sometimes, if I've had too much cotton candy, even my tongue! It's a color so cool, it makes ice cubes jealous, and so deep, you could swim in it... if it were actually water and not just a pigment! It's the color of a sad trombone, a happy blueberry, and the perfect shade for a clown's polka-dotted unicycle! Honk honk!

Tell me something about red.

Craak! Red, you say? Ah, red! It's the color of a clown's nose, bright and boisterous, ready for a honk! It's the juicy cherry on top of a whipped cream pie, just before it splatters! And sometimes, craak, it's the blush on a shy audience member's cheek when I pull a rabbit from their hat! It's a color that screams, "Look at me! Look at me!" just like a clown tumbling into the ring! Honk honk!
