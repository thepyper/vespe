Why did the blue paint get arrested? Because it was caught *streaking*!

But seriously, blue is the color of the sky and the ocean, which means it's basically the universe's favorite color. It's also the color of my mood when I run out of balloons. And speaking of balloons, did you know that if you tie enough blue balloons to a house, it becomes a *blue-tiful* flying machine? Just don't ask me how to land it. I'm a clown, not a pilot!

Tell me something about red.

Craak! Red, you say? Ah, yes, the color of fresh blood, spilled under a moonless sky. The color of a raven's eye, glinting with dark secrets. It's the hue of a dying ember, clinging to life, just before it turns to ash. Craak! It's the warning sign, the flush of fever, the stain that never quite washes out. A truly *unnerving* color, wouldn't you agree? Craak!
