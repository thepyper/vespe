Here are 5 trivia facts about the color orange:

1.  The color orange was named after the fruit. Before the 15th century, when Portuguese merchants brought orange trees to Europe from Asia, the color was often referred to as "yellow-red" in English.
2.  The vibrant orange hue in many fruits and vegetables, such as carrots, pumpkins, and oranges, is due to photosynthetic pigments called carotenes.
3.  Orange is frequently used as a safety color because it is highly visible across various lighting conditions and is less likely to be confused with natural elements. This is why it's seen on traffic cones, safety equipment, and even the Golden Gate Bridge, which is painted "international orange" to protect against rust and enhance visibility in fog.
4.  In several Asian cultures and religions, including Buddhism and Hinduism, orange (or saffron) holds significant symbolic meaning, representing purity, spirituality, and the highest state of illumination. Monks and holy men often wear orange robes.
5.  Ancient artists created orange pigments from minerals like realgar and orpiment. Realgar was used in Egyptian tomb paintings, and orpiment, despite containing arsenic and being toxic, was traded in the Roman Empire and used in Chinese medicine.

Here are 5 trivia facts related to the color sepia, with a note on its relation to yellow:

1.  **Origin from Cuttlefish Ink:** The word "sepia" comes from the Ancient Greek word "sēpía," meaning "cuttlefish." The pigment was originally derived from the ink sac of the common cuttlefish.
2.  **Historical Use:** Sepia ink was widely used for writing and drawing in Greco-Roman times and remained a popular drawing material for artists until the 19th century.
3.  **Photographic Toning:** Sepia toning became popular in photography in the late 19th century. It's a chemical process that gives black-and-white prints a warm, brownish hue, creating a vintage or antique look, and also helped preserve photographs.
4.  **Modern Composition:** While historically from cuttlefish, modern sepia colors are often created using mixtures of synthetic iron oxide pigments with black, or by mixing red, yellow, and black pigments in paint to achieve the characteristic brownish-yellow tone.
5.  **Symbolism and Aesthetics:** Sepia is often associated with nostalgia, history, and antiquity, evoking a sense of warmth and comfort. It's frequently used in art and photography to create a timeless, vintage, or old-fashioned feel.

Regarding "sepia yellow," it's not a distinct color with its own unique set of trivia. Rather, "sepia" itself often has yellowish undertones, and the term "sepia yellow" would likely refer to a lighter, more yellowish variation within the sepia color spectrum, often achieved by adding more yellow pigment when mixing colors.

Here are 5 trivia facts about the color violet:

1.  **Rarity in Nature:** Violet is one of the rarest colors found in nature, especially in flowers. When you do see "violet" flowers, they are often closer to purple or lavender.
2.  **Associated with Royalty and Spirituality:** Historically, violet has been associated with royalty, wealth, and spirituality. This is partly due to the expense of violet dyes in ancient times, making it accessible only to the very rich.
3.  **Shortest Wavelength of Visible Light:** Violet light has the shortest wavelength and highest frequency of all the colors in the visible spectrum. It's at the very end of the rainbow, just before ultraviolet light, which is invisible to the human eye.
4.  **Symbol of Creativity and Imagination:** In color psychology, violet is often linked to creativity, imagination, wisdom, and spiritual awareness. It's believed to inspire and encourage artistic expression.
5.  **Distinction from Purple:** While often used interchangeably, violet and purple are technically different. Violet is a spectral color, meaning it has its own wavelength on the electromagnetic spectrum. Purple, on the other hand, is a composite color created by mixing red and blue light.
