### TODO: Feedback Loop Clarification

**Issue:** The current feedback loop in `BasicAgent::execute` (specifically how LLM responses are processed and fed back) is causing confusion and unexpected behavior. The LLM seems to be generating a full plan in its initial response, which the agent then processes iteratively, leading to a verbose output that doesn't clearly reflect the turn-by-turn interaction.

**Verification Command:**
`cargo run -- chat my_agent "please read file 'test2.txt', then summarize it, then pass the summary to echo tool"`

**Observations:**
*   The LLM generates a sequence of actions (e.g., read_file, summarize, echo) in a single JSON array.
*   The agent processes these actions one by one, making new LLM calls within the same `execute` loop iteration.
*   The output is verbose and mixes intermediate steps, making it hard to follow the agent's actual turns of reasoning.

**Goal:** Clarify the feedback loop to ensure the agent's execution flow aligns with the LLM's iterative reasoning, and the output clearly reflects each turn of interaction.
