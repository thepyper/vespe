Woof woof! Red and blue are different colors, silly human! Red is a warm color, like a fiery sunset or a juicy apple, and it makes you think of things like passion and danger. Blue, on the other paw, is a cool color, like the big sky or the deep ocean, and it often makes you feel calm or a little bit sad. Woof woof!
