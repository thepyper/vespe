Create realistic user request (not \"please use the X tool\")\r\n2. Match the specified use case and complexity naturally\r\n3. Include appropriate context for the context_length parameter\r\n4. Use language style matching user_style parameter\r\n5. Make tool usage feel natural and necessary\r\nGenerate exactly one user prompt that matches all parameters.\r\nDO NOT include any preamble nor explanation to the prompt.\r\nALL OF YOUR OUTPUT MUST BE ONLY THE PROMPT.\r\n\r\n=== OUTPUT ===\r\n",
