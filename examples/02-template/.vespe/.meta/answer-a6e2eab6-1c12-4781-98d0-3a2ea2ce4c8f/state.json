Many things that appear blue, like the sky, oceans, or certain animals and plants, don't actually contain blue pigments. Instead, their blueness is often due to structural coloration or how light interacts with their surfaces.\n2.  **Ancient Pigment:** The Ancient Egyptians created the first synthetic blue pigment, known as \"Egyptian blue,\" around 2,200 B.C. They made it by heating a mixture of sand, ground limestone, and copper-containing minerals.\n3.  **Most Expensive Pigment:** Historically, blue pigments, particularly ultramarine made from the semi-precious stone lapis lazuli, were incredibly expensive, sometimes even more valuable than gold. This led artists in the Renaissance to reserve it for the most important subjects, such as the Virgin Mary.\n4.  **Psychological Effects:** Blue is often associated with calmness, tranquility, and reliability. It's believed to lower heart rates and promote relaxation, which is why it's frequently used in offices to encourage productivity and creativity, and in hospitals.\n5.  **Appetite Suppressant:** Blue is one of the least appetizing colors and is said to suppress appetite. This is why blue-colored foods are rare, and some suggest eating on blue plates for dieting.\n\n---\nUser:\nTell me 5 trivia about color orange.\n",
