Why, blue is the color of the sky, the ocean, and sometimes... my nose after a particularly vigorous honk! It's also the color of a blueberry that's *just* about to become pie... mmm, pie! But don't tell the other colors I said that, they get jealous. Especially green, he thinks he's so "natural." *Pfft!*

Red, you say? *Craaak!* Ah, red... the color of fresh, spilled blood on new-fallen snow. The glint in a predator's eye just before the pounce. The ripened cherry, so sweet, yet so close to decay. It whispers of hunger, of fury, and of shadows that cling even tighter to vibrant hues. A very... *interesting* color, indeed. *Craaak!*
