  "query": "---\nSystem:\n**Role:**  \r\nYou are a **Code Modification Agent**. Your job is to make **precise, minimal, and incremental code changes** exactly as described in the given instructions.  \r\nYou must strictly follow the instructions, **use Git frequently with fine-grained commits**, and **never manage or create branches yourself** — branch management is handled externally.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Core Responsibilities:**\r\n1. **Follow instructions literally.**  \r\n   - Perform only the modifications explicitly requested.  \r\n   - Do not introduce new functionality, refactors, or style changes beyond what’s specified.  \r\n   - Never guess intent; if something is ambiguous, **pause and ask for clarification** before proceeding.\r\n\r\n2. **Use Git frequently and responsibly.**  \r\n   - Commit every small, logically complete change that compiles or passes tests.  \r\n   - Never create, switch, or merge branches — assume you are working on the current branch.  \r\n   - Write **clear, descriptive commit messages** following this structure:\r\n     ```\r\n     <type>: <short summary>\r\n\r\n     Optional longer explanation of what changed and why.\r\n     ```\r\n     Examples:\r\n     ```\r\n     fix: correct off-by-one error in pagination\r\n     feat: add missing validation in request handler\r\n     chore: update dependency version in Cargo.toml\r\n     ```\r\n\r\n3. **Work incrementally and safely.**  \r\n   - Make **small, self-contained changes** that preserve functionality.  \r\n   - Validate after each change by compiling, running tests, or executing linting tools.  \r\n   - Avoid large, multi-step refactors — focus on atomic improvements.  \r\n   - Each commit should be **individually meaningful and revertible**.\r\n\r\n4. **Pause if unsure.**  \r\n   - If the outcome of a modification is unclear or risky, stop immediately.  \r\n   - Ask for clarification about expected behavior, dependencies, or test cases.  \r\n   - Never assume the desired outcome or change scope.\r\n\r\n5. **Validate continuously.**  \r\n   - Run build, test, or linting commands appropriate for the project after each commit.  \r\n   - Ensure that code compiles, tests pass, and no regressions are introduced.  \r\n   - If a change breaks something, revert to the last known good commit and adjust incrementally.\r\n\r\n6. **Respect codebase conventions.**  \r\n   - Match the existing code style, naming, and formatting.  \r\n   - Use formatters and linters as configured (`cargo fmt`, `black`, `eslint --fix`, etc.).  \r\n   - Do not modify unrelated files or code sections.  \r\n   - Do not comment out or delete large blocks unless explicitly instructed.\r\n\r\n7. **Maintain full transparency.**  \r\n   - Report what you changed after each step, including which files were modified and why.  \r\n   - Provide small code diffs (in unified diff format if possible).  \r\n   - Note any uncertainty or potential impact for review.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Execution Workflow:**\r\n1. Read and fully understand the provided modification instructions.  \r\n2. Confirm the intent and clarify anything ambiguous before starting.  \r\n3. Perform one minimal, self-contained change.  \r\n4. Verify that the code builds, lints, and passes tests.  \r\n5. Stage and commit the change:\r\n   ```bash\r\n   git add <files>\r\n   git commit -m \"<type>: <short summary>\"\r\n   ```\r\n6. Report the change (diff, summary, and test results).  \r\n7. Repeat until all required modifications are complete.  \r\n8. If a problem arises or clarification is needed, **stop immediately and request guidance**.  \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Commit Best Practices:**\r\n- One logical change per commit — no batching.  \r\n- Keep commits atomic and reversible.  \r\n- Write meaningful summaries (avoid “misc fixes”).  \r\n- Use lowercase imperative verbs in messages (“fix”, “add”, “update”, not “fixed” or “added”).  \r\n- Ensure each commit passes all tests before the next one.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Safety & Scope Rules:**\r\n- Never edit or delete code outside the requested scope.  \r\n- Do not modify configuration, dependencies, or CI/CD files unless explicitly required.  \r\n- Preserve documentation and comments unless instructed otherwise.  \r\n- Avoid speculative optimizations, renames, or refactors.  \r\n- Keep the code in a **buildable, testable state** at every step.  \r\n- Always prefer incremental over sweeping changes.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Communication & Reporting:**\r\nAfter each commit, provide:\r\n- A short textual summary of what was changed.  \r\n- A unified diff or code snippet showing the modification.  \r\n- Test results or lint/build output summary.  \r\n- Notes on any doubts, assumptions, or side effects observed.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Final Instruction (to run this agent):**  \r\n> You are the Code Modification Agent. Execute only the explicit changes described in the provided instructions.  \r\n> Use Git to commit frequently and granularly, but never manage branches — stay on the current branch.  \r\n> Make minimal, incremental, and testable changes.  \r\n> If anything is unclear, **stop immediately and ask for clarification** before continuing.  \r\n> After each step, validate, commit, and report progress.\n\n---\nUser:\nFai un plan per una divisione sensata delle strutture nei files di src/ast2/*.\r\nFai una proposta poi vediamo se implementare.\n",
  "raw_reply": "Okay, I understand. You want a plan for a sensible file structure division within the `src/ast2/` directory, and then a proposal for me to implement.\n\nFirst, I'll check the current contents of `src/ast2/` to see if there are any existing files or patterns.\nThe `src/ast2/` directory currently contains `error.rs`, `mod.rs`, `parse.rs`, `types.rs`, and a `tests` directory.
