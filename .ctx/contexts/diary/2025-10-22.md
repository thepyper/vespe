aggiungi del debug in src/execute2/execute.rs usando tracing::debug! per farmi capire cosa succede.

I have added debug tracing to `src/execute2/execute.rs` and committed the changes. You can now run the application with `RUST_LOG=debug` (or a similar environment variable depending on your shell) to see the debug output.
