When you do see \"violet\" flowers, they are often closer to purple or lavender.\n2.  **Associated with Royalty and Spirituality:** Historically, violet has been associated with royalty, wealth, and spirituality. This is partly due to the expense of violet dyes in ancient times, making it accessible only to the very rich.\n3.  **Shortest Wavelength of Visible Light:** Violet light has the shortest wavelength and highest frequency of all the colors in the visible spectrum. It's at the very end of the rainbow, just before ultraviolet light, which is invisible to the human eye.\n4.  **Symbol of Creativity and Imagination:** In color psychology, violet is often linked to creativity, imagination, wisdom, and spiritual awareness. It's believed to inspire and encourage artistic expression.\n5.  **Distinction from Purple:** While often used interchangeably, violet and purple are technically different.
