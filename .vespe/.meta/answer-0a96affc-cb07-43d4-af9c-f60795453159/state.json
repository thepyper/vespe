It transcends language, culture, and generations. It's often the first riff aspiring guitarists learn, a universal shorthand for rock and roll itself.\n\nImagine it not just as a sound, but as a persistent, vibrational energy that has permeated every corner of the globe since its inception. It represents:\n\n1.  **Ubiquity:** It's played in countless garages, concert halls, commercials, and even as a cultural meme. Its presence is truly global and timeless.\n2.  **Influence:** It laid a cornerstone for hard rock and heavy metal, inspiring countless bands and musicians. Its simplicity and power are a masterclass in rock composition.\n3.  **Legacy:** It encapsulates the raw energy, technical prowess, and enduring appeal of Deep Purple. It's more than just a song; it's a cultural phenomenon that has outlived its creators and continues to resonate with new audiences.\n\nThis \"echo\" is the biggest Deep Purple thing because it's an abstract, ever-present force that defines their monumental impact on music, far surpassing any physical monument or collection of albums.\n",
