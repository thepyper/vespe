  "reply": "I need to restructure the documentation for the `@answer` tag in `src/execute2/tag_answer.rs`. I will split it into two sections: a basic one and an advanced one. The advanced section will contain all parameters except the simplest ones (like `provider`).\n\nFirst, I will read the content of `src/execute2/tag_answer.rs` to understand the current documentation.\nThe `src/execute2/tag_answer.rs` file lacks the `@answer` tag parameter documentation. I suspect this documentation resides in `README.md`, as the user wants to restructure it. I will now read `README.md` to locate it.\nI've located the `@answer` tag documentation in `README.md`. My plan is to extract this section, then divide it into \"Basic\" and \"Advanced\" parameter descriptions. \"Basic\" will cover `provider` and `dynamic`, while \"Advanced\" will include `input`, `input_data`, `prefix`, `prefix_data`, `postfix`, `postfix_data`, `output`, and `choose`. Finally, I'll replace the original `@answer` section with these two new, distinct sections in `README.md`.\nUpdated `README.md` by splitting `@answer` tag documentation. Committing changes now.\n`README.md` is modified. Untracked files and a diary entry exist, but I'll ignore them. Staging `README.md` now for commit.\n`README.md` is staged. Committing with a descriptive message.\nChanges committed. `README.md` restructured. Task complete.\n`README.md` changes are committed, as confirmed by `git status`. Other files are irrelevant to this task. I've finished restructuring `README.md`. I am done.\nThe `README.md` has been successfully updated and the changes committed.\nI am done with the task.\n",
