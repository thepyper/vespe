Woof woof!

Red and blue are both primary colors, but they are on opposite ends of the visible light spectrum, woof! Red has a longer wavelength and lower frequency, while blue has a shorter wavelength and higher frequency. This difference in wavelength is what makes our eyes perceive them as distinct colors, woof!

Woof woof!
