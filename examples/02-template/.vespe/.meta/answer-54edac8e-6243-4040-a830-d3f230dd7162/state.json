Many things that appear blue, like the sky, oceans, or certain animals and plants, don't actually contain blue pigments. Instead, their blueness is often due to structural coloration or how light interacts with their surfaces.\n2.  **Ancient Pigment:** The Ancient Egyptians created the first synthetic blue pigment, known as \"Egyptian blue,\" around 2,200 B.C. They made it by heating a mixture of sand, ground limestone, and copper-containing minerals.\n3.  **Most Expensive Pigment:** Historically, blue pigments, particularly ultramarine made from the semi-precious stone lapis lazuli, were incredibly expensive, sometimes even more valuable than gold. This led artists in the Renaissance to reserve it for the most important subjects, such as the Virgin Mary.\n4.  **Psychological Effects:** Blue is often associated with calmness, tranquility, and reliability. It's believed to lower heart rates and promote relaxation, which is why it's frequently used in offices to encourage productivity and creativity, and in hospitals.\n5.  **Appetite Suppressant:** Blue is one of the least appetizing colors and is said to suppress appetite. This is why blue-colored foods are rare, and some suggest eating on blue plates for dieting.\n\n---\nUser:\nTell me 5 trivia about color orange.\n\nAssistant:\nHere are 5 trivia facts about the color orange:\n\n1.  **Named After the Fruit:** Unlike many colors, \"orange\" was named after the fruit of the same name. Before the fruit was widely known in Europe, the color was often referred to as \"yellow-red\" or \"red-yellow.\"\n2.  **Associated with Autumn:** Orange is strongly associated with autumn, harvest, and Halloween due to the changing colors of leaves and the prevalence of pumpkins and gourds during this season.\n3.  **Visibility and Safety:** Orange is a highly visible color, especially in contrast to natural environments. This is why it's frequently used for safety equipment, such as traffic cones, life rafts, and hunting vests.\n4.  **Psychological Effects:** Orange is often associated with enthusiasm, creativity, determination, and success. It's considered an energetic color that can stimulate activity and appetite.\n5.  **Rarity in National Flags:** Despite its vibrancy, orange is one of the least common colors found in national flags. When it does appear, it often symbolizes specific cultural or historical meanings, such as the Dutch royal house (House of Orange-Nassau) or Hinduism in India.\n\n---\nUser:\nTell me 5 trivia about color yellow.\n",
