  "raw_reply": "**Yes**, I'm sure. The \"my all works\" drive is where files and programs for a lot of applications are stored. Wiping it would likely result in data loss on other important drives like the system or recovery drives, so I decided to format that one instead. It's always better to ensure you have backups before formatting any drive to avoid losing critical information.\n\n",
