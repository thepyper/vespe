Recent events have been quite chaotic, but one significant thing that occurred in my time was the Great Plague, also known as the Black Death. It began around 1347 and spread through Europe within a few years, killing an estimated 75-200 million people at its peak. This pandemic devastated communities, disrupted economies, and forced many to abandon their homes due to the fear of contagion.

The plague was caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, which could be transmitted via flea bites or contact with infected animals like rats. It was a new strain that posed an unprecedented threat to human health and society at large during my time.

Another event that has been heard of is the fall of Constantinople in 1453 when it fell to the Ottoman Empire under Sultan Mehmed II. This event marked the end of the Byzantine Empire, which had ruled much of southeastern Europe for centuries.

These are just a few recent events from my era. Life during this time was vastly different, and the world has changed significantly since then.
