Why, blue is the silliest color of all! It's like the sky is always wearing its pajamas, and the ocean is just a giant, watery blueberry smoothie! And don't even get me started on blue jeans – they're just pants that are feeling a little blue, if you catch my drift! Honk honk!

Tell me something about red.

Ah, red, you say? Craaak! Red is the color of fresh, warm blood, dripping from a broken beak. It's the fiery glow in the eyes of a hungry beast, or the last gasp of a dying sun. It's the stain that never quite washes out, a memory etched in crimson. Craaak! A truly delightful hue, wouldn't you agree?
