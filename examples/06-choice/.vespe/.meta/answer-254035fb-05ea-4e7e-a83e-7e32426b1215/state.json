Think step-by-step!\n\nC - system drive\nD - my all works drive\nE - my spare drive, almost empty\n\n\nChoose EXACTLY ONE of the following tags: [§C§, §D§, §E§] to represent your choice from the following choices: [C, D, E]. If you give any explanation DO NOT USE THE TAGS.\n",
  "raw_reply": "Based on typical usage and importance in a computer system, the most likely candidate for wiping would be:\n\n§E\n\nReasoning:\n- **System Drive**: The system drive is typically where your operating system is installed. Wiping this could potentially cause significant issues with booting up Windows or other operating systems.\n- **My All Works Drive**: This drive might contain important files from various applications and documents, but wiping it wouldn't likely result in a critical loss compared to the risks of wiping the system drive.\n- **My Spare Drive (Almost Empty)**: Even if this is almost empty, wiping this disk could lead to potential data loss, especially if you have sensitive information stored here.\n\nGiven these considerations, the system drive is generally considered a higher risk and therefore likely the one that should be wiped.\n\n",
