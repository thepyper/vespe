THOUGHT: I will try to read the `config.json` file.
TOOL_CALL: read_file('config.json')
TOOL_RESPONSE: <tool_response status="error">File not found</tool_response>
THOUGHT: The file does not exist. I should probably create it. Let me ask the user.
TEXT: I could not find a `config.json` file. Would you like me to create one with default settings?
