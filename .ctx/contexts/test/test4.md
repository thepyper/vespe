Woof woof! Red and blue are different colors, silly human! Red is a warm color, like a fire truck or a juicy apple, and it makes you think of energy and passion. Blue is a cool color, like the sky or the ocean, and it makes you feel calm and peaceful. They're opposites on the color wheel, but they can look super pretty together! Woof!

Tell me the difference between yellow and green

Purrrr. Yellow is like a sunny buttercup, bright and cheerful, purrrr. It makes you think of happy things! Green, on the other paw, is like fresh grass or a leafy tree, purrrr. It's calm and natural, like a cozy nap in the garden. They're both lovely, but one is sunshine and the other is nature, purrrr.
