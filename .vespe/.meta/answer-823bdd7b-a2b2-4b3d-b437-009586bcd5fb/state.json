  "reply": "Your `README.md` is already quite comprehensive and well-structured! It clearly explains what `vespe` is, its philosophy, how it works, and provides good installation and getting started guides.\n\nHere are some suggestions to make it even better, focusing on visual appeal, content enhancement, and clarity:\n\n### 1. Visual Appeal & Navigation\n\n*   **Badges:** Add badges at the top for things like build status, version, license, and potentially a \"crates.io\" badge if it's published there. This provides quick, at-a-glance information.\n*   **Table of Contents (TOC):** For a README of this length, a generated Table of Contents at the beginning would significantly improve navigation, allowing users to jump to sections of interest.\n*   **Screenshots/GIFs:** A short GIF or screenshot demonstrating `vespe` in action, especially the `watch` mode and how an LLM's response is injected, would be incredibly powerful. Visuals can convey the core concept much faster than text.\n*   **Consistent Formatting:** Review for consistent use of bolding, italics, and code formatting throughout the document.\n\n### 2. Content Enhancements\n\n*   **More Use Cases/Examples:** While \"Getting Started\" is excellent, consider adding a dedicated \"Use Cases\" section. This could showcase more diverse or advanced applications, such as:\n    *   Generating blog post outlines.\n    *   Summarizing research papers.\n    *   Creating interactive learning materials.\n    *   Automating documentation updates.\n*   **Troubleshooting/FAQ:** A small section addressing common issues or frequently asked questions could help users quickly resolve problems.\n*   **Future Plans/Roadmap (Optional):** Briefly mentioning what's next for `vespe` can generate excitement and encourage community involvement.\n\n### 3. Clarity & Conciseness\n\n*   **\"NO-WARRANTY\" Section:** This section is crucial but quite long. You could consider:\n    *   Condensing it to a shorter paragraph with a strong warning.\n    *   Moving the detailed text to a separate `DISCLAIMER.md` file and linking to it from the README.\n*   **Tag Syntax - JSON-like Object:** When describing the flexible JSON-like object, explicitly state the deviations from standard JSON (e.g., \"keys don't need quotes, string values don't need quotes if they are single words without special characters\"). This clarifies the \"more flexible\" aspect.\n*   **Provider Examples Consistency:** In the \"Prerequisites\" section, for Google Gemini, you mention `gemini -y`. For consistency with the \"Getting Started\" example, you might want to suggest `gemini -y -m gemini-2.5-flash` as a more complete example.\n\nThese are just suggestions, and your current `README.md` is already very good!\n",
