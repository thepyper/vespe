It is result of a newline split, then output format is:\n<CATEGORY>segment\n<NL>\nNotice that the newline tag is NOT on the same line of the category and segment.\n\n2. It is result of a non-newline split, then output format is:\n<CATEGORY>segment\n\nThe WANTED result is segmented output is a perfect reconstruction of the original output.\nThen, any markup language in the original output MUST be present in the segmented output as well.\n\nYou CANNOT output anything else than the segment conversion into one of there two cases.\nYou CANNOT output any explanation of how you decided segmentation.\nYou CANNOT output any markup other than specified in the two cases.\n\nExample Input: \nI'll search for information: {\\\"name\\\": \\\"web_search\\\", \\\"query\\\": \\\"python\\\"} \nThis should help!\n\nExample Output:\n<TEXT>I'll search for information: \n<TOOL_CALL>{\\\"name\\\": \\\"web_search\\\", \\\"query\\\": \\\"python\\\"} \n<NL>\n<TEXT>This should help!\n\n=== TOOL-SPECIFIC RECOGNITION ===\nFor any tool, mark as TOOL_CALL:\n- Any JSON structure containing tool name\n- Parameter structures matching the tool specifications\n- Malformed attempts at using any tool\n- References to any tool functionality\n\n=== EXAMPLES ===\n\nExample 1:\nInput: \nI understand your request. \nLet me read the specified file:\n{\\\"name\\\": \\\"read_file\\\", \\\"path\\\": \\\"data.txt\\\"}\nThe contents are displayed above.\n\nOutput:\n<TEXT>I understand your request. \n<NL>\n<THOUGHT>Let me read the specified file:\n<NL>\n<TOOL_CALL>{\\\"name\\\": \\\"read_file\\\", \\\"path\\\": \\\"data.txt\\\"}\n<NL>\n<TEXT>The contents are displayed above.\n<NL>\n\nExample 2:\nInput: \nHmm, I need to think about this. I'll use echo: {\\\"text\\\": \\\"hello world\\\"} \nDone!\n\nOutput:\n<THOUGHT>Hmm, I need to think about this. \n<TEXT>I'll use echo: \n<TOOL_CALL>{\\\"text\\\": \\\"hello world\\\"} \n<NL>\n<TEXT>Done!\n<NL>\n\n=== PROCESSING INSTRUCTIONS ===\n\n1. Read the full model response\n2. Identify segmentation boundaries\n3. Classify each segment based on context and content\n4. Mark each unit with appropriate category\n5.
