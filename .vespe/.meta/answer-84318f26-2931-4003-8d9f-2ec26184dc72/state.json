  "reply": "Okay, I will now document the \"Cli usage\" section. I'll begin by reading `H:\\my\\github\\vespe\\src\\bin\\ctx\\main.rs` and any other necessary files to understand the CLI's functionality.\nI've analyzed `main.rs` and understand the CLI structure via `clap`: `vespe` (or `ctx`) with global `--project-root` and `--context-template` flags. It has `init`, `watch`, and `context` subcommands (`new`, `execute`), with `execute` accepting a context name, a `--today` flag, arguments, and reading from `stdin`. Next, I'll check `README.md` to place the new \"Cli usage\" section.\nI've reviewed the `README.md` and will replace the placeholder \"Cli usage\" section with a detailed one based on `main.rs`. My plan is to re-read the `README.md`, draft the new section covering `init`, `context new`, `context execute` (including arguments and piped input), and `watch`, then use the `replace` tool to update the file and commit the changes. The draft is ready.\n`README.md` updated. Committing now: stage `README.md`, commit with message, then run `git status` to verify.\nStaged. Committing.\nCommitted. Running `git status`.\nI've documented and committed the \"Cli usage\" section in `README.md`. The `git status` shows unrelated, expected changes in the `.ctx` directory. My task is complete.\nStaged. Committing.\nDiary committed. Request complete.\nDiary file deleted. Request complete.\nI've documented the \"Cli usage\" in `README.md`, committed the changes, and am ready to notify the user.I documented the CLI usage in the `README.md`, committed the changes, committed the diary file, and then removed it. I'm done.Okay, request complete. I'll respond now.I've documented the \"Cli usage\" in `README.md`, committed the changes, and I'm done.\n",
