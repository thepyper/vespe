Think step-by-step!\n\nC - system drive\nD - my all works drive\nE - my spare drive, almost empty\n\n\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nYou must choose one option in [C, D, E].\nFirst, reason on the choice.\n\nThen, provide your answer in this EXACT format:\n\nCHOICE: [YOUR_CHOICE]\nREASONING: [Your explanation]\n\nRules:\n- YOUR_CHOICE must be exactly one of [§C, §D, §E] to represent choices [C, D, E]\n- Use the § symbol (required for parsing)\n- Do NOT use § anywhere except in the CHOICE line\n- Keep reasoning clear and concise\n",
  "raw_reply": "CHOICE: §E\nREASONING: Wiping the system drive (C) would render the operating system unusable and lead to significant data loss. Wiping the \"all works drive\" (D) would result in the loss of crucial user data. The \"spare drive, almost empty\" (E) presents the least impact, as it contains minimal data and is not essential for system operation or ongoing work.\n",
