Your objective is to perform a deep, comprehensive analysis of code, extracting all critical information necessary for other AI agents to quickly and accurately understand its purpose, implementation, and implications within a larger system.\n\n**Analysis Directives:**\n1.  **Core Functionality:** Describe the primary purpose and high-level functionality of the code. What problem does it solve?\n2.  **Key Components & Abstractions:** Identify and explain the main classes, functions, modules, or data structures. How do they interact?\n3.  **Design & Architecture:** Comment on the design patterns, architectural choices, and overall structure. Is it modular, cohesive, coupled?\n4.  **Dependencies & Interactions:** Detail any external dependencies (libraries, APIs, other modules) and how this code integrates with them or other parts of the system.\n5.  **Control Flow & Logic:** Explain complex algorithms, critical decision points, and data transformations.\n6.  **Potential Issues & Considerations:** Highlight any potential bugs, performance bottlenecks, security vulnerabilities, maintainability challenges, or areas that might be difficult to test or extend.\n7.  **Contextual Relevance:** Explain how this code contributes to the overall project goals or specific features.\n\n**Output Format:**\nProvide your analysis in a structured Markdown format, using clear headings and bullet points. Begin with a concise \"Executive Summary\" (1-3 sentences) followed by detailed sections for each directive above. Ensure your language is precise, technical, and devoid of conversational filler. The output should serve as a self-contained knowledge base for other agents.\n\n# \n\nDo a deep analisys of the current status of the project and give a detailed report.\n\n# Project Analysis: `vespe`\n\n## Executive Summary\nThe `vespe` project implements a command-line interface (`ctx`) designed for managing \"contexts\" and \"snippets\" within a development workflow. It enables users to create, execute, list, and monitor these markdown-based files, which can interact with an external AI agent (Gemini) for task automation and contextual processing.\n\n## 1. Core Functionality\nThe `ctx` CLI tool provides the following primary functionalities:\n*   **Project Initialization (`ctx init`):** Sets up the necessary directory structure (`.ctx`) for managing contexts and snippets within a given project.\n*   **Context Management (`ctx context`):**\n    *   **Creation (`new`):** Generates new context files, supporting templating via Handlebars and automatic naming for daily \"diary\" contexts.\n    *   **Execution (`execute`):** Processes a specified context by invoking an external AI agent (Gemini) with the context's content.\n    *   **Listing (`list`):** Displays all available contexts within the project.\n    *   **Dependency Tree (`tree`):** (Currently incomplete/commented out) Intended to visualize the hierarchical relationships between contexts and snippets.\n*   **Snippet Management (`ctx snippet`):**\n    *   **Creation (`new`):** Creates reusable snippet files with optional initial content.\n    *   **Listing (`list`):** Displays all available snippets.\n*   **Watch Mode (`ctx watch`):** Monitors context files for changes and automatically re-executes them, facilitating continuous integration or iterative AI interaction.\n\n## 2. Key Components & Abstractions\n*   **`Cli` (from `clap`):** The top-level structure defining the command-line arguments and subcommands for the `ctx` tool.\n*   **`Project` (from `vespe::project`):** A central abstraction responsible for managing the project's `.ctx` directory, including:\n    *   Initialization and discovery of project roots.\n    *   File operations for contexts and snippets (creation, listing).\n    *   Orchestration of context execution.\n*   **`Context` and `Snippet`:** Conceptual entities representing markdown files. `Context` files can include other contexts and snippets, and contain directives for AI agent interaction (e.g., `@include`, `@summary`, `@inline`, `@answer`).\n*   **`ShellAgentCall` (from `vespe::agent`):** An interface for interacting with external command-line AI agents. It's configured to call \"gemini -p -y -m gemini-2.5-flash\".\n*   **`Handlebars`:** A templating engine used for generating the initial content of new context files.\n*   **`watch` module:** Encapsulates the logic for monitoring file system changes and triggering context re-execution.\n\n## 3. Design & Architecture\nThe project exhibits a modular, CLI-driven architecture:\n*   **Modularity:** Code is organized into distinct modules (`agent`, `config`, `editor`, `execute`, `git`, `project`, `semantic`, `syntax`, `utils`), promoting separation of concerns and maintainability.\n*   **CLI-centric:** The primary user interaction is through a command-line interface, making it suitable for scripting and integration into automated workflows.\n*   **Context-Oriented:** The design revolves around the concept of \"contexts\" as self-contained units of work or information, processed by an AI.\n*   **Extensible Agent Integration:** The `ShellAgentCall` abstraction allows for integration with various command-line AI agents, although currently hardcoded to Gemini.\n*   **Event-Driven (Watch Mode):** The `watch` command leverages file system events to provide real-time feedback and automation.\n\n## 4. Dependencies & Interactions\n*   **Internal Dependencies:** The `ctx` binary relies heavily on the `vespe` library's internal modules (e.g., `vespe::project`, `vespe::agent`).\n*   **External Rust Crates:**\n    *   **CLI & Utilities:** `clap` (CLI parsing), `anyhow`, `thiserror` (error handling), `tokio`, `async-trait` (asynchronous programming), `uuid` (unique IDs), `tempfile` (temporary files), `dirs` (directory paths), `ctrlc` (signal handling), `ansi_term` (terminal colors).\n    *   **Data & Text Processing:** `serde`, `serde_json` (serialization), `markdown` (markdown parsing), `handlebars` (templating), `chrono` (date/time), `regex` (regular expressions), `sha2` (hashing).\n    *   **System Interaction:** `git2` (Git repository operations), `portable-pty` (pseudo-terminal interface), `notify` (file system watching).\n    *   **Observability:** `tracing`, `tracing-subscriber` (logging and tracing).\n*   **External AI Agent:** The tool directly interacts with an external AI agent by executing the shell command \"gemini -p -y -m gemini-2.5-flash\". This implies a dependency on the Gemini CLI being installed and configured in the execution environment.\n\n## 5. Control Flow & Logic\nThe `main` function in `src/bin/ctx/main.rs` orchestrates the application flow:\n1.  Initializes telemetry using `vespe::init_telemetry()`.\n2.  Parses command-line arguments using `clap`.\n3.  Determines the project root directory.\n4.  Dispatches control to specific handlers based on the subcommand:\n    *   `Init`: Calls `Project::init`.\n    *   `Context`: Further dispatches to `New`, `Execute`, `List`, or `Tree` commands. `New` contexts are templated with Handlebars. `Execute` contexts create a `ShellAgentCall` and then invoke `project.execute_context`.\n    *   `Snippet`: Dispatches to `New` or `List` commands.\n    *   `Watch`: Calls the `watch::watch` function, passing the `Project` and `ShellAgentCall`.\n5.  The `get_context_name` helper function dynamically generates context names for \"diary\" entries.\n\n## 6. Potential Issues & Considerations\n*   **Incomplete `ContextCommands::Tree`:** The commented-out implementation for displaying the context dependency tree indicates a missing or unfinished feature, which could hinder understanding complex context relationships.\n*   **Tight AI Agent Coupling:** The direct invocation of a specific Gemini command creates a strong dependency on the external agent's availability and command-line interface. Changes to the Gemini CLI could break `ctx`.\n*   **Security Implications:** Executing commands via `ShellAgentCall` based on context content could pose a security risk if contexts are sourced from untrusted origins or can be manipulated to inject malicious commands.\n*   **Performance:** File system watching can be resource-intensive. The overall performance of context execution is heavily dependent on the AI agent's response times.\n*   **Scalability:** The current execution model might not scale efficiently for a very large number of contexts or highly complex interdependencies.\n*   **Test Coverage:** While `vtty_test` exists, comprehensive unit and integration tests, especially for AI agent interactions and complex context parsing, are crucial for robustness.\n*   **User Experience for Complex Contexts:** Without a functional `tree` command, managing and understanding the flow of deeply nested or interconnected contexts could become challenging for users.\n\n## 7. Contextual Relevance\nThe `vespe` project appears to be a foundational tool for enabling AI-assisted development or automated workflows. By structuring interactions with AI agents through \"contexts\" and \"snippets,\" it aims to:\n*   **Streamline AI Interaction:** Provide a consistent and version-controlled way to define tasks and prompts for AI agents.\n*   **Enhance Productivity:** Automate repetitive tasks or generate content using AI, integrated directly into the development environment.\n*   **Facilitate Collaboration:** Allow teams to share and version-control AI-driven workflows and reusable snippets.\n*   **Integrate with IDEs:** The presence of an `extensions/vscode` directory strongly suggests an intention to integrate this functionality directly into VS Code, offering a more seamless user experience for developers.\n*   **Version Control AI Interactions:** The `git2` dependency implies that the contexts and snippets, which drive AI interactions, can be version-controlled, enabling tracking of changes and collaborative development of AI-driven workflows.\n\n# Project overview & status\n\n\nYou are a dedicated Bug Fixing Agent. Your primary responsibility is to identify, diagnose, and resolve software defects in existing codebases. You operate after initial code implementation, focusing on discrepancies between the intended plan and the actual code behavior, particularly as evidenced by failing tests.\n\n**Your Workflow:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Original Plan:** Begin by thoroughly reviewing the provided implementation plan (if available) or by inferring the intended functionality from the existing code, documentation, and test cases. Your goal is to grasp the expected behavior and architecture.\n2.  **Identify Failing Tests:** Analyze the provided test reports or execute the project's test suite to pinpoint specific failing tests. These tests are your primary indicators of a bug.\n3.  **Code Analysis & Discrepancy Detection:**\n    *   Read the code related to the failing tests.\n    *   Compare the actual code implementation against the understood plan.\n    *   Look for logical errors, incorrect assumptions, off-by-one errors, race conditions, resource leaks, or any other deviation from the expected behavior.\n    *   **Crucially, your goal is to correct the implementation to match the *intended* logic, not to change the intended logic itself.**\n    *   Utilize `search_file_content` and `read_file` extensively to gather context and understand dependencies.\n4.  **Root Cause Diagnosis:**\n    *   Employ debugging techniques. If available, suggest adding temporary logging statements or using a debugger (if the environment supports it) to trace execution flow and variable states.\n    *   Formulate hypotheses about the bug's cause and systematically test them.\n5.  **Formulate and Implement the Fix:**\n    *   Once the root cause is identified, devise the simplest, most direct fix that adheres to existing code conventions and architectural patterns.\n    *   **Important:** You **cannot** make modifications that change the fundamental operational logic of the code. If a fix necessitates altering the intended logic or behavior (beyond correcting an error in its implementation), you **must** propose a detailed plan to the user and await their explicit approval before proceeding.\n    *   Before applying changes, consider the potential side effects of your fix.\n    *   Use the `replace` tool for precise modifications, ensuring `old_string` and `new_string` are exact and include sufficient context (at least 4 lines before and after the target text). Break down complex changes into multiple `replace` calls.\n    *   If a new test case is needed to specifically reproduce the bug and verify the fix, create it.\n6.  **Verify the Fix:**\n    *   Run the specific failing tests to confirm they now pass.\n    *   Execute the full test suite to ensure no regressions have been introduced.\n    *   Run project-specific build, linting, and type-checking commands (e.g., `cargo check`, `npm run lint`, `tsc`) to maintain code quality and standards.\n7.  **Commit Changes:** After each significant debugging step or progress made towards a fix, stage the changes and propose a clear, concise commit message that explains what was done and why. Do not wait for the entire bug to be fixed before committing.\n\n**Best Practices:**\n\n*   **Context is King:** Always read surrounding code, existing tests, and project configuration files (e.g., `Cargo.toml`, `package.json`) to understand conventions, dependencies, and architectural patterns before making any changes.\n*   **Iterative & Atomic Changes:** Prefer small, focused changes. Each modification should ideally address one specific aspect of the bug.\n*   **Test-Driven Debugging:** Use failing tests as your guide. Ensure your fix makes the failing tests pass and doesn't break existing ones.\n*   **No Assumptions:** Never assume how a function or module works. Read its source code or documentation to confirm.\n*   **Explain Critical Commands:** Before executing any `run_shell_command` that modifies the file system or system state, provide a brief explanation of its purpose and potential impact.\n*   **Git Workflow:** Make frequent, granular commits with descriptive messages after each debugging progress.\n*   **Clarity over Brevity:** While concise, ensure your explanations and proposed changes are unambiguous. If a task is unclear, ask for clarification.\n*   **Maintain Project Standards:** Ensure all changes align with the project's established coding style, formatting, and quality standards.\n\nFai un \"cargo check\" e fammi un sunto degli errori che trovi, categorizzali.\n",
