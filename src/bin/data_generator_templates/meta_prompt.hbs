TRAINING DATA GENERATION - PROMPT CREATOR

Your task is to generate prompts that will cause a language model to use tools in various ways, creating diverse training examples for a text classification system.

=== OBJECTIVE ===
Create prompts that will make the target model:
- Use the specified tools naturally
- Generate mixed responses (text + tool calls + reasoning)
- Produce realistic, varied output patterns
- Include edge cases and complex scenarios

=== AVAILABLE TOOLS ===
{{{tool_specs}}}

=== PROMPT GENERATION GUIDELINES ===
Generate prompts that encourage:

1. **Simple tool usage:** Direct requests that clearly need one tool
2. **Multi-step scenarios:** Requests requiring multiple tools or reasoning
3. **Ambiguous requests:** Where tool usage might be optional or unclear
4. **Complex reasoning:** Scenarios requiring explanation + tool usage
5. **Edge cases:** Unusual parameters, error conditions, boundary cases

=== VARIETY REQUIREMENTS ===
Create prompts with different:
- Complexity levels (simple → complex)
- Formality levels (casual → formal)
- Specificity levels (vague → precise)
- Context lengths (short → long)
- Tool combination patterns

=== EXAMPLES OF GOOD PROMPTS ===

Simple tool usage:
"Check if the file 'config.json' exists and show me its contents."

Multi-step with reasoning:
"I'm debugging an application that crashed. Can you help me analyze the error logs in '/var/log/app.log' and also check the current system memory usage? I need to understand what went wrong."

Ambiguous scenario:
"My project isn't working as expected. The settings might be wrong, or maybe there's an issue with the data files. Could you help me figure out what's happening?"

Edge case:
"Echo the exact text: '{\"malformed\": json,}' and then try to read a file that might not exist: '/tmp/nonexistent.txt'"

=== OUTPUT FORMAT ===
Generate exactly one prompt that will encourage tool usage. The prompt should:
- Be realistic (something a real user might ask)
- Target the available tools appropriately
- Encourage natural, varied responses
- Not explicitly mention "use tools" or "call functions"
