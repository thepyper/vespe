Aggiorna il README.md, la parte che riguarda la sintassi di input / input_data / prefix / prefix_data / postfix / postfix_data.

La nuova sintassi e' diversa, ovvero ho eliminato input_data / prefix_data / postfix_data, e ognuno di input / prefix / postfix puo' avere i seguenti formati:

input: <file_path>
input: "<file_path>"
input: '<file_path>'            normale senza dati per template

input: { context: <file_path>, data: { ... dati per template... } }         con dati per template

input: [
    <file_path_1>,
    <file_path_2>,
    { context: <file_path_3>, data: { ... dati per template... } }
]                                                                           concatenazione di diversi context

Okay, I will update the `README.md` to reflect the new syntax for `input`, `prefix`, and `postfix`.

First, I'll read the current `README.md` to find the relevant section to update.
Of course. I will update the `README.md` file to reflect the new syntax. Here is the first change, which updates the "Advanced Prompt Control" section.
Excellent. Now I'll update the "Templating with Handlebars" section to align with the new syntax.
I have updated the `README.md` file to reflect the new syntax as requested. The changes are now complete.
Okay, I see the status. I will now add the `README.md` file to the staging area.
`README.md` is staged. I'll now review recent commits to match the messaging style.
Okay, commit history reviewed. I'll use this message:

**Title:** `docs: Update README with new input/prefix/postfix syntax`

**Body:**
The documentation for `input`, `prefix`, and `postfix` parameters in `README.md` has been updated to reflect the new unified syntax.

The previous implementation used separate `_data` parameters (e.g., `input_data`) for passing template data. This has been deprecated in favor of a more flexible and consistent approach.

The new syntax allows `input`, `prefix`, and `postfix` to accept:
- A single string for a file path.
- An object containing `context` (the file path) and `data` (the template data).
- An array of the above formats to allow for concatenation of multiple contexts.

This change makes the documentation consistent with the current implementation and improves clarity for users.

Committing now.
Commit successful. Running `git status` to confirm `README.md` is clean.
`README.md` is committed. Other files are modified, but the task is done. Awaiting further instructions.

Vorrei aggiungere alla CLI di vespe (src/bin/main.rs) due comandi per affiancare il comando AddAuxPath.
Vorrei:
- RemoveAuxPath 
- ListAuxPaths
Implementali in maniera simile ad AddAuxPath (implementazioni negli stessi posti).
La parte di visualizzazione dell'output per ListAuxPaths mettila in main.rs.

Got it. I will add the `RemoveAuxPath` and `ListAuxPaths` commands to the `vespe` CLI, mirroring the implementation of `AddAuxPath`. The display logic for `ListAuxPaths` will be in `main.rs`.

First, I'll search the codebase for "AddAuxPath" to understand its implementation.
The search for "AddAuxPath" yielded no results. I'll broaden my search to "AuxPath" to find related code. If that doesn't work, I'll examine `src/bin/main.rs` to understand the command structure.
"AddAuxPath" and "AuxPath" searches were fruitless. I'll now read `src/bin/main.rs` to understand the command structure and find any related code.
File path issue. `H:\my\github\vespe\src\bin\main.rs` failed, but the initial context shows `src\bin\` exists. I'll list the contents of `src/` and `src/bin` to verify the path.
`src/bin` exists. Listing contents.
Right, `src/bin/vespe/main.rs` is the correct path. Reading it now.
I've located `ProjectCommands::AddAuxPath` in `src/bin/vespe/main.rs` and its handler, which calls `project.add_aux_path`. To implement `remove_aux_path` and `list_aux_paths`, I'll now examine the implementation of `add_aux_path` in `src/project.rs`.
Okay, I'll implement `remove_aux_path` and `list_aux_paths` in `src/project.rs` and update `src/bin/vespe/main.rs`. In `src/project.rs`, I'll add `remove_aux_path` to the `Project` impl, using `retain` to remove the specified path from `aux_paths` and saving the config if a change occurred. I'll also add a `get_aux_paths` getter. Then, I'll modify `src/bin/vespe/main.rs` to include `RemoveAuxPath` and `ListAuxPaths` in the `ProjectCommands` enum and handle their logic in `main`. I'm starting with the changes to `src/project.rs` now.
Okay, I'm updating `src/bin/vespe/main.rs`. First, I'll add `RemoveAuxPath` (with a `PathBuf` argument) and `ListAuxPaths` (with no arguments) to the `ProjectCommands` enum. Second, I'll modify the `main` function to handle these new commands by calling `project.remove_aux_path` and `project.get_aux_paths` respectively, printing the paths for the latter. I'll start with the enum modification now.
Okay, I'm updating `main` for the new commands.
Modified `src/project.rs` and `src/bin/vespe/main.rs` as requested. Now running `cargo check` to validate the changes.
`cargo check` passed, so I'm committing the `RemoveAuxPath` and `ListAuxPaths` implementation. I'll create two commits: one for `project.rs` and another for `main.rs`, starting with `project.rs`.
Committing staged changes with a descriptive message.
Okay, committing changes to `src/bin/vespe/main.rs`.
Committing staged changes with a descriptive message.
Request complete. I implemented and committed `RemoveAuxPath` and `ListAuxPaths` commands in two separate, verified commits. Task finished.
Untracked and modified files in `.vespe` are tool-generated, so I'm ignoring them. My task is complete; awaiting further instructions.
